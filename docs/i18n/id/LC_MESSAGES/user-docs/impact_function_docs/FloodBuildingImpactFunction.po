"The inundation status is calculated for each building (using the centroid if "
"it is a polygon) based on the hazard levels provided. if the hazard is given "
"as a raster a threshold of 1 meter is used. This is configurable through the "
"InaSAFE interface. If the hazard is given as a vector polygon layer "
"buildings are considered to be impacted depending on the value of hazard "
"attributes (in order) \"affected\" or \"FLOODPRONE\": If a building is in a "
"region that has attribute \"affected\" set to True (or 1) it is impacted. If "
"attribute \"affected\" does not exist but \"FLOODPRONE\" does, then the "
"building is considered impacted if \"FLOODPRONE\" is \"yes\". If neither "
"\"affected\" nor \"FLOODPRONE\" is available, a building will be impacted if "
"it belongs to any polygon. The latter behaviour is implemented through the "
"attribute \"inapolygon\" which is automatically assigned."
