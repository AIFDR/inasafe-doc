"In impact function is a software programme that computes a risk assessment "
"given a number of inputs. The risk assessment will typically have a spatial "
"component (e.g. a GIS layer which can be incorporated into a map) and a non-"
"spatial component (e.g. a list of actions you may want to consider carrying "
"out, or a list of estimates of disaster risk reduction elements such as how "
"many bags of rice to make available)."
