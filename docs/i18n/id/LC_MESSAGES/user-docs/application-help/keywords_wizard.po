msgid "This wizard will lead you through the process of defining keywords for an exposure, hazard or aggregation layer. Unlike the :ref:`keywords editor <keywords_editor>`, the keywords wizard 'understands' the constraints and rules that determine which keywords can be applied to any given layer. For example, if you have a raster layer, the keywords wizard will use impact function metadata to prevent you declaring that the layer contains road exposure data since by definition, such data must be vector line data."
