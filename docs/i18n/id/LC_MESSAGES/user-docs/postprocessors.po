"Post-processors and their settings can be edited in the user configurable "
"function parameters dialog. See :ref:`analysis_parameters` to find the "
"correct buttons. To disable a post-processor simply go to the :guilabel:"
"`Postprocessors` tab and enable or disable any post-processor you like by "
"clicking on the checkbox next to it. You can even set the postprocessing "
"values you like here by entering the values in the fields. The same is valid "
"for any other setting you might encounter there. If you don't see a post-"
"processors field, it means that the impact function you are trying to use "
"does not support any post processor"
