"Load a polygon layer in QGIS. Typically the layer will represent "
"administrative districts where people have gone to an evacuation center. "
"Ensure that the layer has an INTEGER attribute for the number of displaced "
"people associated with each feature. Use the pick lists below to select the "
"layer and the population field and then press :guilabel:`OK`. A new layer "
"will be added to QGIS after the calculation is complete. The layer will "
"contain the minimum needs per district/administrative boundary."
