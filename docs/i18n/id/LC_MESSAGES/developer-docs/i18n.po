"Sutton: scripts/create-transifex-resources.sh [3:17:22 PM] Tim Sutton: and "
"then wait quite a long time [3:17:30 PM] Tim Sutton: the script basically "
"does this: [3:17:50 PM] Tim Sutton: - makes sure each po source file is "
"registered as a transifex resource [3:18:16 PM] Tim Sutton: - adds a "
"translation source for each locale (determined by subdirs of i18n dir) "
"[3:18:29 PM] Tim Sutton:   for each resource [3:18:47 PM] Tim Sutton: - "
"pushes the resources and their translation files to transifex [3:18:52 PM] "
"Tim Sutton: eof [3:19:17 PM] Tim Sutton: when you want to collect any "
"translations from transifex, it is the reverse process so you do: [3:19:25 "
"PM] Tim Sutton: tx pull [3:19:32 PM] Tim Sutton: scripts/post_translate.sh "
"[3:20:01 PM] Tim Sutton: git commit -m \"Updated translations from transifex "
"community edited translation files\" -a [3:20:07 PM] Tim Sutton: eof "
"[3:20:25 PM] Tim Sutton: that will basically ensure that any translations "
"done on transifex get put into git [3:20:55 PM] Tim Sutton: note that in "
"scripts/create-transifex-resources.sh there is a VERSION variable that must "
"be configured for each QGIS release [3:21:07 PM] Tim Sutton: in the form 1-8 "
"(. char is not allowed) [3:21:28 PM] Tim Sutton: so that is the theoretical "
"procedure [3:21:46 PM] Tim Sutton: you can also push a po file individually "
"using the command line client like this: [3:22:07 PM] Tim Sutton: tx push -s "
"-t -l de -r qgis-documentation.v1-8-docs-qgis-gui [3:22:54 PM] Tim Sutton: "
"that will push the source (-s) and translation file (-t) for language (-l) "
"de for the resource (-r) qgis-documentation.v1-8-docs-qgis-gui up to the "
"transifex web server [3:23:04 PM] Tim Sutton: however running that I see the "
"same error you reported: [3:23:11 PM] Tim Sutton: Remote server replied: "
"Error uploading file: There is a syntax error in your file [3:23:26 PM] Tim "
"Sutton: so lets try that msgfrmt -c command and see if we can figure out why"
