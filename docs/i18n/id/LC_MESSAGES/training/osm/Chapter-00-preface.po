"Free, collaborative maps are uniquely valuable to humanitarian work, "
"especially in places where base map data is often scarce, out-of-date, or "
"rapidly changing. OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a web project to create a free and "
"open map of the entire world, built entirely by volunteers surveying with "
"GPS, digitising aerial imagery, and collecting and liberating existing "
"public sources of geographic data. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (|"
"HOT|) is an initiative to apply the principles and activities of open source "
"and open data sharing towards humanitarian response and economic development."

"Every day thousands of people contribute to OSM, a project with the lofty "
"goal of mapping the world. Most OSM software is free and open source, and "
"the data is open for anyone to use. The idea is simple: if you make a map of "
"your town and we make a map of ours, we can share those maps on a common "
"platform. With enough people contributing, we can collect data throughout "
"the world."

"Collecting Spatial Data using OpenStreetMap is a step-by-step course "

"at first, OSM is simple enough that anyone can get started creating maps, "
