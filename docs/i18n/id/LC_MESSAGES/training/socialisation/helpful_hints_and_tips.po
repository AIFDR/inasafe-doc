msgid "**Where do I get Hazard and Exposure data from?** As explained in |project_name| functionality chapter (page 13), you are able to get open exposure data from  www.asiapop.org for population and  from OpenStreetMap for structures (however you may need to still digitise the structures go to www.learnosm.org for more details). To download OSM data see Appendix :guilabel:`Getting OpenStreetMap Data` (page 56). For hazard information it is best to approach your government science agencies or local universities to model earthquake, tsunami or floods. However if it floods regularly in your region you could also develop a community flood-prone footprint."
