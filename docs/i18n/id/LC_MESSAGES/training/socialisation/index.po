"As one of the most hazard-prone and densely populated countries in the "
"world, Indonesia faces significant risk of loss of lives and challenges to "
"development progress as a result of natural disasters. The development of "
"disaster management plans is seen as an important step to strengthen "
"disaster risk reduction programs. However, this can only be effective when "
"risk assessments and contingency planning utilise realistic hazard "
"scenarios. Realistic hazard scenarios require scientific, sound and up-to-"
"date data hazard information as well as up-to-date, scale appropriate "
"exposure data. Such map-based risk assessments and contingency plans "
"contribute to better disaster management planning and response."
