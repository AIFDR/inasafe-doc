"In `Run Basic InaSAFE <http://docs.inasafe.org/en/training/socialisation/"
"run_basic_inasafe.html/>`__ we learned how to run a flood analysis on "
"population and buildings, adjust the flood impact default settings and "
"analyze impact summary report, and change analysis threshold. We also "
"learned how to save our work and generate a pdf of the analysis results. In "
"this exercise we will learn more techniques such as how to run |"
"project_name| with aggregation data to produce reports broken down by "
"districts or regions. We will also learn how to download data using the "
"OpenStreetMap downloader and how to run |project_name| analysis on the "
"downloaded building polygons and roads. Last but not least, we will learn "
"how to define the analysis area."
