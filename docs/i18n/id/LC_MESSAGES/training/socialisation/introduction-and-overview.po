"As one of the most hazard-prone and densely populated countries in the "
"world, Indonesia faces significant risk of loss of lives and challenges to "
"development progress as a result of natural disasters. The development of "
"contingency plans is seen as an important step to strengthen disaster risk "
"reduction programs.However this can only be effective when contingency plans "
"utilises realistic hazard scenario. Realistic hazard scenarios require "
"scientific, sound and up-to-date data related to sources of hazard and "
"elements of exposure.  Such map-based contingency plans offer accurate and "
"comprehensive results in calculating minimum relief items, identifying safe "
"places, and sectorial planning."

"An Impact function will automatically be chosen depending on the keywords "
"that has been allocated to the input layers. The purpose of the keywords "
"file is to provide additional metadata needed by the impact functions. For "
"example, the keywords file will indicate whether a given dataset should be "
"treated as a hazard or an exposure layer. It is also used to indicate the "
"context of the layer (e.g. flood, earthquake)."
