"A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a system designed to enable people "
"to work with data related to places on the Earth.  A GIS allows the "
"creation, storage, manipulation, and analysis of geographic data.  GIS is a "
"very broad concept and can involve complex hardware and software.  But for "
"most people's purposes, a simple GIS software application is all that is "
"required, and in this unit we will learn how to use the excellent open-"
"source application, Quantum GIS."

"GIS has an important role in contingency planning.  A contingency plan is "

"A Geographic Information System is able to help planners answer these "
"questions, especially the important spatial elements of contingency "
"planning.  GIS may be used to model hazardous events so that they can be "
"better predicted and reduce risk.  It may be used to plan evacuation routes "
"prior to a disaster.  When a disaster occurs, GIS may also play a role in "
"the emergency response phase.  It can be used to map the area affected and "
"position of refugee camps, so that helpers can be directed to the most "
"useful locations to aid those affected.  After a disaster, GIS may also be "
"used to plan for rehabilitation and reconstruction.  Overall, GIS helps to "
"perform analysis of a disaster, damage and losses caused, and opportunities "
"for reducing risk."

"The Importance of Data We previously learned how to start collecting "
"exposure data.  When thinking about GIS it is important to remember that if "

"a disaster."

"As we shall see in this unit, some data may be obtained from various "

"specialize in this.  As for exposure data, some data we may find through "
"agencies, such as population data.  For ever important infrastructure data, "
"collecting data at a community level is key, which is why in the previous "

"QGIS is awesome because: 1. It's completely free.  It doesn't cost anything. "
"2. It's free, as in liberty.  If you think a feature is missing, you can "
"sponsor the development of a feature, or add it yourself if you are familiar "
"with programming. 3. It's constantly developing and improving.  Because many "
"people continue adding features, it keeps getting better. 4. Extensive help "
"and documentation is available.  If you have problems you can always turn to "
"the software documentation, other QGIS users, or even the developers."
