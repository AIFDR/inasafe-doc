"Communication model training is one component in the training process "
"because it is actually a method implementation in training. To maximize "
"output in the training, a trainer has to select a training method in "
"accordance with the other components, such as the objectives, materials, "
"trainees, facilities and assessment. So to be able to achieve the objectives "
"set in the training, methods of training and communication should receive "
"special attention in any training process."
