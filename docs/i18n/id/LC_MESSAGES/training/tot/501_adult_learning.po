"(Townsend Coles 1977 in Lanundi (1982), adult education is defined as the "
"entire body of organized educational processes, whatever the content, level "
"and method, whether formal or otherwise, whether they prolong or replace "
"initial education in schools, colleges and universities as well as in "
"apprenticeship, whereby persons regarded as adult by the society to which "
"they belong develop their abilities, enrich their knowledge, improve their "
"technical or professional qualifications and bring about changes in their "
"attitudes or behavior in the twofold perspective of full personal "
"development and participation in balanced and independent social, economic "
"and cultural development. Meanwhile, according to Bryson in Supriyanto "
"(2007) Adult education comprises all educational activities in which adults "
"engage in their daily life using only  a part of their time and energy in "
"order to gain additional intellectual knowledge."
msgstr "Pendidikan orang dewasa adalah suatu usaha yang ditujukan untuk pengembangan diri yang dilakukan oleh individu tanpa paksaan legal, tanpa usaha menjadikan bidang utama kegiatannya (Reeves, Fansler, dan Houle dalam Supriyanto, 2007). Menurut UNESCO (Townsend Coles 1977 dalam Lanundi (1982), Pendidikan orang dewasa adalah keseluruhan proses pendidikan yang diorganisasikan apa pun isi, tingkatan, metodenya, baik formal atau tidak, yang melanjutkan maupun menggantikan pendidikan semula di sekolah, akademi dan universitas serta latihan kerja, yang membuat orang yang dianggap dewasa oleh masyarakat mengembangkan kemampuannya, memperkarya pengetahuannya, meningkatkan kualifikasi teknis atau profesuonalnya, dan mengakibatkan perubahan pada sikap dan perilakunya dalam perspektif rangkap perkembangan pribadi secara utuh dan partisipasi dalam pengembangan sosial, ekonomi, dan budaya yang seimbang dan bebas. Sedangkan menurut Bryson dalam Supriyanto (2007) Pendidikan orang dewasa adalah semua aktivitas pendidikan yang dilakukan oleh orang dewasa dalam kehidupan sehari-hari yang hanya menggunakan sebagian waktu dan tenaganya untuk mendapatkan tambahan itelektual."

"Evaluation is an activity to determine how far a learning program is "
"implemented according to expectations. Therefore, evaluation is focused on "
"activities to determine  how far a program is successful (micro: "
"facilitator, macro: institution). According to Fajar, A., (2002), evaluation"
" can be defined as an effort to gain various kinds of information "
"periodically, continuously and comprehensively about learning process and "
"outcome, as well as the growth and development of participants’ attitudes "
"and behaviors. The above definition shows that evaluation is also carried "
"out during training program and not only at the end of training. Evaluation "
"constitutes a process to paint a picture of changes among participants after"
" training. The word process means that evaluation is a continuous endeavor, "
"using certain methods to reach expected outcome. This process also sees that"
" evaluation is conducted by gathering facts in a systematic way. This "
"definition shows that an evaluation requires data gathering or measurement."

"The techniques, methods or tools of evaluation comprise all methods or "
"procedures taken to gather information or data needed as material to "
"evaluate. The techniques used in evaluation play an important role in the "
"outcome.  Basically, evaluation techniques or methods can be divided into "
"two types i.e. test technique or method and non-test technique or method. In"
" cognitive aspects, a test in the form of questions (both in writing or "
"verbally ) can be used. It is expected that this aspect can enhance the "
"affective aspect of training participants. Affective aspect can be "
"identified through observation and questionnaire, while psycho-motor aspect "
"can be evaluated through activities conducted and results achieved."

"The theory of evaluation above is actually similar in both pedagogy and "
"andragogy, with the difference being only in ways of evaluating. In adult "
"learning, the evaluation method must reflect freedom in that the evaluation "
"must come from the person learning, not forced from outside. This implies "
"that adults must be able to evaluate themselves. Therefore, the term ‘test’ "
"for adults should be referred to more appropriately as self- examination. An"
" example of evaluation method suitable for adults is as follows:"
