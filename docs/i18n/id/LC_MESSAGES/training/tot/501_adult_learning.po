"Adult education is an endeavor aimed at self development made by individuals "
"without legal forces, without making this endeavor their main activity "
"(Reeves, Fansler, and Houle in Supriyanto, 2007). According to UNESCO "
"(Townsend Coles 1977 in Lanundi (1982), adult education is defined as the "
"entire body of organized educational processes, whatever the content, level "
"and method, whether formal or otherwise, whether they prolong or replace "
"initial education in schools, colleges and universities as well as in "
"apprenticeship, whereby persons regarded as adult by the society to which "
"they belong develop their abilities, enrich their knowledge, improve their "
"technical or professional qualifications and bring about changes in their "
"attitudes or behavior in the twofold perspective of full personal "
"development and participation in balanced and independent social, economic "
"and cultural development. Meanwhile, according to Bryson in Supriyanto "
"(2007) Adult education comprises all educational activities in which adults "
"engage in their daily life using only  a part of their time and energy in "
"order to gain additional intellectual knowledge."
