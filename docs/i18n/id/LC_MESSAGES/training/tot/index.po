"trainers in Scenario Development program for Contingency Planning (SD4CP) in "
"their respective regions. After completing the training, participants will "
"have the facilitation skills in OSM / QGIS / InaSAFE which are needed as a "
"facilitator, and training skills to help train others in developing a "
"realistic disaster scenario that can be used in contingency plans. This will "
