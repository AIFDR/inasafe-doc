msgid "In the very south tip of Sirahan you should find a building that is identified as a hospital. This building is, in fact, a real world hospital, and it is an actual IDP camp. Compare it with your result. This should be one of the buildings that your analysis deems suitable as a camp, and when you consider that it is also a hospital, it clearly makes a good location."
