msgid "When we are working in |project_name|, hazard data refers to a vector or raster dataset that represents the level and magnitude of an event that can potentially cause damages. To be used for impact calculation in |project_name|, level and magnitude of an event scenario must be mapped over the area of interest. This means that hazard data must be geographic - it must have location. We have already looked at hazard data for the 2007 Jakarta Flood and the Lembang Earthquake. These hazard layers were produced from scientific modeling conducted by scientific organizations and government agencies. These are typical sources for such hazard data, although in cases of flood hazards such data may also be gathered from affected communities."
