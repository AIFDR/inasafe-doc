msgid "By now you should have a pretty good understanding of how InaSAFE works and its operations. You know how to add the appropriate layers, and how to define keywords to the layers so that InaSAFE can recognize them appropriately. Now that we can use InaSAFE effectively to run scenario analyses, we will look at other QGIS functionality that will help us in preparing contingency plans. In this Module, we will learn how to perform a GIS analysis in order to determine an appropriate evacuation route in the event of a disaster."

msgid "The term **fastest route** indicates the route a person can take between point A and point B that will allow them to cover the distance in the least amount of time. Similarly, shortest path indicates the route that will allow a person to get from point A to point B with the least distance traveled. In theory, this would be a straight line between point A and point B, but in reality this is impractical, because traveling in a straight lines means climbing hills and going around buildings and fences.  Of course this is why we use roads, and why we calculate fastest and shortest routes using roads. We will use the Road Graph plugin in this Module, which does just that. If we provide two points, the plugin is able to calculate either the fastest route or the shortest path between them."
