msgid "Similarly, shortest path indicates the route that will allow a person to get from point A to point B with the least distance traveled. In theory, this would be a straight line between point A and point B, but in reality this is impractical, because traveling in a straight lines means climbing hills and going around buildings and fences.  Of course this is why we use roads, and why we calculate fastest and shortest routes using roads."
