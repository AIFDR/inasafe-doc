"Aerial imagery works the same, except that we talk about resolution "

"which means that one pixel in the image is equivalent to two metres on the "
"ground. One metre resolution imagery would have a higher resolution than "
"this, and 50cm resolution would be higher still. This is generally the range "
"of imagery that is provided by Bing, though it varies between locations, and "
"in many places it is worse than two metres, at which point it becomes "
"difficult to identify objects in the image."
