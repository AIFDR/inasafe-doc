"As you may recall, there are two types of data that we often use in QGIS: "
"raster and vector data. Raster data is characterised as an array of data "
"which consists of rows and columns, like the pixels in an image. Vector "
"data, on the other hand, consists of discrete features made of points and "
"lines, and their position is defined by coordinates."
