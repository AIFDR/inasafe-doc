"A Geographic Information System is able to help planners answer these "
"questions, especially the important spatial elements of contingency "
"planning. GIS may be used to model hazardous events so that they can be "
"better predicted and reduce risk. It may be used to plan evacuation routes "
"prior to a disaster. When a disaster occurs, GIS may also play a role in the "
"emergency response phase. It can be used to map the area affected and "
"position of refugee camps, so that helpers can be directed to the most "
"useful locations to aid those affected. After a disaster, GIS may also be "
"used to plan for rehabilitation and reconstruction. Overall, GIS helps to "
"perform analysis of a disaster, damage and losses caused, and opportunities "
"for reducing risk."
