msgid "Replacement of prototype earthquake impact system which has been running at BPNB since August 2011. The replacement will address some shortcomings of the prototype to do with appearance of automatically generated map, extensibility and maintenance. The transition to |project_name| also allows for the inclusion of fatality estimates. The replacement was developed by Tim Sutton in Q3/Q4 of 2012 and is running at |AIFDR| and |AusAID|. Still outstanding is obtaining feedback from |BNPB| on the design and deployment at |BNPB|."
