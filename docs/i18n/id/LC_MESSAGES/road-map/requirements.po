An overarching principle that was decided on in the workshop was that |project_name| should not reimplement functionality that can be done easily with QGIS. Rather this should become the topic of advanced training. |project_name| should focus on simple, repetitive tasks aimed at non-GIS experts and the ability to produce customised reports and maps. The user feedback is grouped loosely by themes. Resource estimates (day, week, month) and priorities (low, medium, high) are given in brackets."
