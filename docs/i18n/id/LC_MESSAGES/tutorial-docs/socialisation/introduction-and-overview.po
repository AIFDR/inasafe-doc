"As one of the most hazard-prone and densely populated countries in the "
"world, Indonesia faces significant risk of loss of lives and challenges to "
"development progress as a result of natural disasters. The development of "
"contingency plans is seen as an important step to strengthen disaster risk "

"scientific, sound and up-to-date data related to sources of hazard and "
"elements of exposure.  Such map-based contingency plans offer accurate and "
