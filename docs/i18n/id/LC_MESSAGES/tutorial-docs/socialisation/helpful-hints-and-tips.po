For example if you have a flood hazard polygon layer that extends far beyond your area of interest, the flood polygons will be reduced so that only the part inside of your area of interested (map canvas extent) is retained. This can speed up processing time somewhat."

msgid "**Where do I get Hazard and Exposure data from?** As explained in InaSAFE functionality chapter (page 13), you are able to get open exposure data from  www.asiapop.org for population and  from OpenStreetMap for structures (however you may need to still digitise the structures go to www.learnosm.org for more details). To download OSM data see Appendix :guilabel:`Getting OpenStreetMap Data` (page 56). For hazard information it is best to approach your government science agencies or local universities to model earthquake, tsunami or floods.  However if it floods regularly in your region you could also develop a community floodprone footprint."
