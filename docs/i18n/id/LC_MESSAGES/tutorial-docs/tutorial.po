"|project_name| is a plugin for QGIS software. It aims to produce realistic "
"natural hazard impact scenarios for better planning, preparedness and "
"response activities, using hazard and exposure geographic data. A user’s "
"manual developed by Ole Moeller Nielsen and Tim Sutton complements this "
"short training material. During this training, you will explore the "
"different components of |project_name| plugin and their usage for an easy-to-"
"use risk and impact scenarios assessments. A data sample will be provided "
"with the present material to give you the ability to learn how to manipulate "
"data in |project_name|, what the requirements of the data are and what kind "
"of results you can expect out of the data."
