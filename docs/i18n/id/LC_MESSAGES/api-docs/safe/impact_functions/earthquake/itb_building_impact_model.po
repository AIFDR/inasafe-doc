"Methodology: The ITB vulnerability model was heuristically developed (i.e. "
"based on expert opinion) through the Bali workshop. The model is defined "
"with two parameters (median, and lognormal standard deviation) of cumulative "
"lognormal distribution. The building type classification used in the model "
"was endorsed by expert group in thel Bali workshop."
