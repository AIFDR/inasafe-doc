"A GPS is like a mobile phone, except that instead of receiving radio signals "
"from telephone companies, it receives signals from satellites that are going "
"around the Earth. By receiving these signals from the satellites, a GPS is "
"able to calculate your exact location on the planet.  It records this "
"location in coordinates, which are two long numbers.  One number tells you "
"how far East or West you are - this is called **longitude**.  The second "
"number tells you how far North or South you are - this is called "
"**latitude**. Every place on Earth has unique geographic coordinates."
