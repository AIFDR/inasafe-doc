"Using aerial imagery is the most widely used approach in making maps with "
"OpenStreetMap.  Mappers typically use Bing satellite as a background layer "

"At first, the satellite image is a combination of photographs and satellite "
"coordinates. Special software is used to calculate each side of the "
"photographs. In general, satellite images have high resolution enables more "
"accurate calculation. But there are thousands of photographs and the surface "
"of the earth is not a perfect circle ellipsoid. Satellite imagery provider "
"can not verify the accuracy of each photo, so the coordinates can be shifted "
"from the actual position. That is why satellite imagery can be shifted 1-2 "
"meters and sometimes up to hundreds of meters. In the mountainous or hilly "
"areas, satellite imagery often has a non-linear distortion. Shift or "
"distortion is called imagery offset / shift satellite imagery."

"Aerial imagery is the same, except that we usually talk about resolution "
"differently.  Measurement is important with aerial photographs - hence, a "
"pixel represents a certain distance on the ground.  We usually describe "
"imagery as something like \"two meter resolution imagery\", which means that "
"one pixel is equivalent to two meters on the ground.  One meter resolution "
"imagery would have a higher resolution than this, and 50cm resolution would "
"be higher still. This is generally the range of imagery that is provided by "
"Bing, though it varies between locations, and in many places it is worse "
"than two meters, at which point it becomes difficult to identify objects in "

"We’ve learned about two major ways of making maps - one is by utilizing "
"aerial imagery to identify features on the ground, and another is by using "
"GPS to record tracks and waypoints and then add them to OpenStreetMap.  The "
"advantage of aerial imagery is obvious.  It enables you, the mapper, to see "
"the whole picture, to observe various details from the image, consider your "
"knowledge of the area, and easily trace roads, buildings, and areas.  One "
"key advantage of GPS however, is that it doesn’t suffer from offset like "
"imagery.  A GPS will always provide you with a correct latitude and "
"longitude.  The only exception is when the satellite signals are interrupted "
"by tall buildings or mountains, but in this case it is easy to recognize the "
"error.  Observe the GPS trace in this image, compared with the Bing aerial "
