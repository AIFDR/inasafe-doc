"Using aerial imagery is the most widely used approach in making maps with "
"OpenStreetMap.  Mappers typically use Bing satellite as a background layer "

"At first, the satellite image is a combination of photographs and satellite "
"coordinates. Special software is used to calculate each side of the "
"photographs. In general, satellite images have high resolution enables more "
"accurate calculation. But there are thousands of photographs and the surface"
" of the earth is not a perfect circle ellipsoid. Satellite imagery provider "
"can not verify the accuracy of each photo, so the coordinates can be shifted"
" from the actual position. That is why satellite imagery can be shifted 1-2 "
"meters and sometimes up to hundreds of meters. In the mountainous or hilly "
"areas, satellite imagery often has a non-linear distortion. Shift or "
"distortion is called imagery offset / shift satellite imagery."

"Aerial imagery is the same, except that we usually talk about resolution "
"differently.  Measurement is important with aerial photographs - hence, a "

"imagery as something like \"two meter resolution imagery\", which means that"
" one pixel is equivalent to two meters on the ground.  One meter resolution "
"imagery would have a higher resolution than this, and 50cm resolution would "
"be higher still. This is generally the range of imagery that is provided by "
"Bing, though it varies between locations, and in many places it is worse "

"We’ve learned about two major ways of making maps - one is by utilizing "

"knowledge of the area, and easily trace roads, buildings, and areas.  One "
"key advantage of GPS however, is that it doesn’t suffer from offset like "
