"Maps are a good way to convey information. Maps are visual representations "
"of our world. They can often demonstrate an idea better than words.  This in "
"turn can also help answer important questions.  Where is the closest school "
"or hospital?  Who has the least access to these facilities?  Where is "
"poverty the most problematic? Questions like these can often best be "
"expressed with maps, and maps can help find solutions to these questions."

"If your town is like most, you may have drawn some lines to represent roads, "
"possibly a river or stream. Perhaps you added important buildings such as "
"schools and offices, fields, or boundaries.  Whatever you drew, you probably "
"used symbols - a line to symbolize a road, a square to symbolize a building, "
"and so on. Your map is a representation of what is on the ground."

"Your map is informative.  You might use a map like this to explain to "
"someone where different places are, where problems are in your community, or "
"merely to help someone find their way around. The uses of your map is "
"limited though. There is only one copy of the map and the way you drew it "
"may make sense to you, but perhaps not to someone else who would have drawn "
"their own map in a different way. Because your map is merely on paper, it is "
"difficult to get that information to others. This is why making your map on "
"a computer, in such a way that anyone can access it, can be much more "
"valuable."

"Map making on computers allows us to collect more useful data than on paper. "
"On paper we might draw a school, and even add it’s name and record some "
"information about the school, but on the computer we can attach an endless "
"amount of data about the school, such as the number of students, number of "
"teachers, size of the building, type of structure, and so on. And more "
"importantly, when we add this school to a digital map, we record it’s "
"precise location (longitude and latitude) on the planet. This is invaluable "
"for our future map making and analysis, and we will look more closely at it "
"later on."

"OpenStreetMap is a tool for creating and sharing map information. Anyone can "
"contribute to OSM, and thousands of people add to the project every day. "
"Users draw maps on computers, rather than paper, but as we will see in this "
"guide, drawing a map on a computer is not all that different from drawing on "
"paper. We still draw lines to represent roads, fields, and anything else, "
"and we still represent schools and hospitals with symbols. The important "
"thing is that OSM maps are saved on the internet, and anyone can access them "
"at any time, totally free."

"OpenStreetMap is digital, which makes it extremely useful for us, and it is "
"shared, which means that everybody benefits from the work of everybody else. "
"The basic idea is this: if you make a map of your street and I make a map of "
"my street, and then more people make maps of their streets, we all can share "
"these maps and this data on a common platform, and use the data for our own "
"projects."

"In the optional module at the start of this training, we used a file that "
"contained buildings in Jakarta.  This data came from OpenStreetMap. While no "
"single person could have mapped 13,000 buildings, many different people "
"contributing just a little bit at a time provided us with a data file that "
"allows us to do very impressive analysis, and help an entire community "
"prepare for the next time there is a flood.  In this sense, the work is "
"somehow cyclical. The community contributes data so that emergency managers "
"can design highly effective contingency plans, and those plans may then be "
"used to benefit the community at large. And the more data that the community "
"provides, the better the contingency planning can be."
