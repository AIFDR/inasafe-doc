"A Geographic Information System is able to help planners answer these "
"questions, especially the important spatial elements of contingency "
"planning. GIS may be used to model hazardous events so that they can be "
"better predicted. It may be used to plan evacuation routes prior to a "
"disaster. When a disaster occurs, GIS may also play a role in the emergency "
"response phase. It can be used to map the area affected and position of "
"refugee camps, so that helpers can be directed to the most useful locations "
"to aid those affected. After a disaster, GIS may also be used to plan for "
"rehabilitation and reconstruction. Overall, GIS helps to perform analysis of "
"a disaster, damage and losses caused, and opportunities for reducing risk."
