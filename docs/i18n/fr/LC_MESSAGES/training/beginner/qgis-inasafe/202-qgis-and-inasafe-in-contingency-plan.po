msgid "A Geographic Information System is able to help planners answer these questions, especially the important spatial elements of contingency planning. GIS may be used to model hazardous events so that they can be better predicted and reduce risk. It may be used to plan evacuation routes prior to a disaster. When a disaster occurs, GIS may also play a role in the emergency response phase. It can be used to map the area affected and position of refugee camps, so that helpers can be directed to the most useful locations to aid those affected. After a disaster, GIS may also be used to plan for rehabilitation and reconstruction. Overall, GIS helps to perform analysis of a disaster, damage and losses caused, and opportunities for reducing risk."

For example, we will obtain our hazard models (hazard data) from various organizations that specialize in this. As for exposure data, some data we may find through agencies, such as population data. For ever important infrastructure data, collecting data at a community level is key, which is why in the previous unit we learned how to utilize the crowd-sourced OpenStreetMap platform."
