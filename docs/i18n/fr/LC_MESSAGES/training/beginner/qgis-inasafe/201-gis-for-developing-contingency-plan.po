"Data is raw facts.  Information is data that is organized and presented in "

"locations and facts about those locations, we have collected data - we have "
"collected facts.  To turn this data into information, we must make sense of "
"it.  We must present the data in such a way that it can be easily understood."

"A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a system designed to enable people "
"to work with data related to places on the Earth.  A GIS allows the "
"creation, storage, manipulation, and analysis of geographic data.  GIS is a "
"very broad concept and can involve complex hardware and software.  But for "
"most peopleâ€™s purposes, a simple GIS software application is all that is "
"required, and in this unit we will learn how to use the excellent open-"
"source application, Quantum GIS."
