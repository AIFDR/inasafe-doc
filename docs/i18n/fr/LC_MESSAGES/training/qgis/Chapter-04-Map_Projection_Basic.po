"are supposed to meet). This means that, as you travel away from the equator "
"on your map, the scale of the objects that you see gets larger and larger. "

"For best fit, the thin-plate spline or higher-number polynomial "
"transformations are often best. Its look like a true rubber sheeting method, "
"transforms the source Control Point exactly to the target Control Points, "
