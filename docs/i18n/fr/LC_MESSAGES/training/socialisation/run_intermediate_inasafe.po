"In `Run Basic InaSAFE "
"<http://docs.inasafe.org/en/training/socialisation/run_basic_inasafe.html/>`__"
" we learned how to run a flood analysis on population and buildings, adjust "
"the flood impact default settings and analyze impact summary report, and "
"change analysis threshold. We also learned how to save our work and generate"
" a pdf of the analysis results. In this exercise we will learn more "
"techniques such as how to run |project_name| with aggregation data to "
"produce reports broken down by districts or regions. We will also learn how "
"to download data using the OpenStreetMap downloader and how to run "
"|project_name| analysis on the downloaded building polygons and roads. Last "
"but not least, we will learn how to define the analysis area."
