"As one of the most hazard-prone and densely populated countries in the "
"world, Indonesia faces significant risk of loss of lives and challenges to "
"development progress as a result of natural disasters. The development of "
"contingency plans is seen as an important step to strengthen disaster risk "
"reduction programs. However, this can only be effective when contingency "
"plans utilise realistic hazard scenarios. Realistic hazard scenarios require "
"scientific, sound and up-to-date data hazard information as well as up-to-"
"date, scale appropriate exposure data. Such map-based contingency plans "
"offer accurate and comprehensive results in calculating minimum relief "
"items, identifying safe places, and sectorial planning."

"|project_name| is free and open source software that provides a simple but "
"rigorous way to combine the data from scientists, local governments and "

"events. The software is focused on examining, in detail, the impacts that a "
"single hazard would have on specific sectors. For example, |project_name| "
"can help users examine the location of primary schools and estimated number "
"of students who would be affected by a possible tsunami in Maumere, "
"Indonesia (when it happened during school hours). |project_name| has been "
"developed as a QGIS plugin to enable end users to not only complete a "
"disaster impact analysis, but to also conduct further geographic analysis "
"using the suite of QGIS tools that are available. The software includes a "
"simple-to-use interface in the hope that disaster managers and other end "
"users can easily create impact maps to inform contingency planning."

"An impact function is automatically chosen depending on the keywords that "
