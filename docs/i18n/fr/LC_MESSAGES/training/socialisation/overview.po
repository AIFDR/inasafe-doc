"As one of the most hazard-prone and densely populated countries in the "
"world, Indonesia faces significant risk of loss of lives and challenges to "
"development progress as a result of natural disasters. The development of "
"contingency plans is seen as an important step to strengthen disaster risk "
"reduction programs. However, this can only be effective when contingency "
"plans utilise realistic hazard scenarios. Realistic hazard scenarios require"
" scientific, sound and up-to-date data hazard information as well as up-to-"
"date, scale appropriate exposure data. Such map-based contingency plans "
"offer accurate and comprehensive results in calculating minimum relief "
"items, identifying safe places, and sectorial planning."

"single hazard would have on specific sectors. For example, |project_name| "
"can help users examine the location of primary schools and estimated number "
"of students who would be affected by a possible tsunami in Maumere, "
"Indonesia (when it happened during school hours). |project_name| has been "
"developed as a QGIS plugin to enable end users to not only complete a "
"disaster impact analysis, but to also conduct further geographic analysis "
"using the suite of QGIS tools that are available. The software includes a "
"simple-to-use interface in the hope that disaster managers and other end "
"users can easily create impact maps to inform contingency planning."

"Impact functions can be written for any contingency planning purpose. One "
"example is the minimum needs (minimum quantity of relief items per person) "
"that need to be supplied to refugees during/after a disaster. The Indonesian"
" Disaster Management Agency (|BNPB|) have identified these needs per day, "
"and |project_name| uses these numbers to calculate how much food, water, "
"toilets, family kits, and other resources are need during/after the disaster"
" based on the number of evacuated people. This output directly informs "
"contingency planners how much of each item is needed to respond to a major "
"disaster."

"An impact function is automatically chosen depending on the keywords that "
"have been allocated to the input layers. The purpose of the keywords file is"
" to provide additional metadata needed by the impact functions. For example,"
" the keywords file will indicate whether a given dataset should be treated "
"as a hazard or an exposure layer. It is also used to indicate the context of"
" the layer (e.g. flood, earthquake). This is discussed in more detail in "
":ref:`keywords_system`."
