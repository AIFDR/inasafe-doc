"As one of the most hazard-prone and densely populated countries in the "
"world, Indonesia faces significant risk of loss of lives and challenges to "
"development progress as a result of natural disasters. The development of "
"contingency plans is seen as an important step to strengthen disaster risk "
"reduction programs. However this can only be effective when contingency "
"plans utilises realistic hazard scenario. Realistic hazard scenarios require "
"scientific, sound and up-to-date data hazard information as well as up-to-"
"date, scale appropriate exposure. Such map-based contingency plans offer "
"accurate and comprehensive results in calculating minimum relief items, "
"identifying safe places, and sectorial planning."

"Impact functions can be written for any contingency planning purpose, one "
"example is the minimum needs (minimum quantity of relief items per per "
"person) that need to be supplied to refugees during/after a disaster. The "
"Indonesian Disaster Management Agency (|BNPB|) have identified these needs "
"per day, and |project_name| has used these numbers to calculate how much "
"food, water, toilets, family kits etc are need during/after the disaster "
"based on the number of evacuated people. This output directly informs "
"contingency planners how much of each item is needed to withstand a major "
"disaster."
