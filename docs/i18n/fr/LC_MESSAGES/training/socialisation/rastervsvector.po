"Vector data is arguably the most common kind of data you will find in the "
"daily use of GIS. It describes geographic data in terms of points, that may "
"be connected into lines and polygons. Every object in a vector dataset is "
"called a feature, and is associated with data that describes that feature."

"Raster data is quite different from vector data. Vector data has discrete "
"features constructed out of vertices, and perhaps connected with lines and/"
"or areas. Raster data, however, is like an image. Although it may portray "
"various properties of objects in the real world, these objects donâ€™t exist "
"as separate objects; rather, they are represented using pixels of various "
"different colour values."

"Basically, Vector data is like using a pen, where you can draw a point, a "
"line or a polygon, Raster data is like taking a picture with a camera, where "
"each square has one value, and all the squares (pixels) combine to make a "
"picture."
