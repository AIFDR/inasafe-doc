"As we are all aware, its generally not the earthquake that kills, its the "
"collapsing buildings that kill the majority of the people. Hence "
"understanding the structure of the building and how they may act under "
"certain shaking is crucial in understanding the impact of an earthquake. "
"Unfortunately earthquakes cover a large area, so mapping every structure in "
"that area is extensive. In Padang the international |OSM| community assisted "
"mapping, totalling roughly 95,000 structures."
