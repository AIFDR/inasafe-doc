"Information is important. With good information and the right understanding, "
"individuals and communities are better able to improve their lives and make "
"good decisions about the future. There are many people and organizations who "
"make decisions that affect our lives. Good information allows these NGO’s "
"(non-government organisations), governments and communities to make better "
"decisions, and hopefully make our lives better."

"Maps are a good way to deliver information. Maps are visual symbols ofour "
"world. They can often demonstrate an idea better than words. This in turn "
"can help us answer important questions. Where is the closest school or "
"hospital? Who has the least access to these facilities? Where is poverty the "
"most problematic? Questions like these can often best be expressed with "
"maps, and maps can help find solutions to these questions."

"As an exercise, get a pen and paper and draw a map of your town or village. "
"What are the most important things to include on the map? What is the most "
"important information? Spend a few minutes making your map, and when you’re "
"finished, think about why the information you included is important, and who "
"it might be important to."

"If your town is like most, you may have drawn some lines to represent roads, "
"possibly a river or stream. Perhaps you added important buildings such as "
"schools and offices, fields, or boundaries. Whatever you drew, you probably "
"used symbols – a line to symbolize a road, a square to symbolize a building, "
"and so on. Your map is a representation of what is on the ground."

"Your map is informative. You might use a map like this to explain to someone "
"where different places are, where problems are in your community, or merely "
"to help someone find their way around. The use of your map is limited though "
"- there is only one copy of the map. The way you drew it may make sense to "
"you, but perhaps not to someone else who would have drawn their own map in a "
"different way. Because your map is merely on paper, it is difficult to get "
"that information to others. This is why making your map on a computer, in "
"such a way that anyone can access it, can be much more valuable."

"OpenStreetMap is a tool for creating and sharing map information. Anyone can "
"contribute to OSM, and thousands of people add to the project every day. "
"Users draw maps on computers, rather than paper, but as we will see in this "
"guide, drawing a map on a computer is not all that different from drawing on "
"paper. We still draw lines to represent roads, fields and anything else and "
"we still represent schools and hospitals with symbols. The important thing "
"is that OSM maps are saved on the internet, and anyone can access them at "
"any time. Most importantly, the data are free."
