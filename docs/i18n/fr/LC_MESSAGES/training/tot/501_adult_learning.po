msgid "Adult education is an endeavor aimed at self development made by individuals without legal forces, without making this endeavor their main activity (Reeves, Fansler, and Houle in Supriyanto, 2007). According to UNESCO (Townsend Coles 1977 in Lanundi (1982), adult education is defined as the entire body of organized educational processes, whatever the content, level and method, whether formal or otherwise, whether they prolong or replace initial education in schools, colleges and universities as well as in apprenticeship, whereby persons regarded as adult by the society to which they belong develop their abilities, enrich their knowledge, improve their technical or professional qualifications and bring about changes in their attitudes or behavior in the twofold perspective of full personal development and participation in balanced and independent social, economic and cultural development. Meanwhile, according to Bryson in Supriyanto (2007) Adult education comprises all educational activities in which adults engage in their daily life using only  a part of their time and energy in order to gain additional intellectual knowledge."

It is better to start with identifying authentic problems of training participants in their daily life. Should the facilitators feel the need to introduce new theories or information, they need to ensure that these  theories  and information are related to problems faced by trainees and real life examples.

The above definition shows that evaluation is also carried out during training program and not only at the end of training. Evaluation constitutes a process to paint a picture of changes among participants after training. The word process means that evaluation is a continuous endeavor, using certain methods to reach expected outcome. This process also sees that evaluation is conducted by gathering facts in a systematic way. This definition shows that an evaluation requires data gathering or measurement."

msgid "Performance evaluation can be conducted using a check list (yes-no questions). With this check list, participants will get points when certain criteria of mastering certain competency are observed by evaluators. In the event no competency is observed, participants will not get any point. The weakness of this method is that evaluators only have two absolute options, right or wrong; observed and not observed. There is no middle ground. Nevertheless, check list is more practical to be used to observe subjects in great number. The following is an example of a check list."
