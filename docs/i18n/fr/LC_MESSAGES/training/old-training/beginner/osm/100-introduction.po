"Every day thousands of people contribute to OSM, a project with the lofty "
"goal of mapping the world. Most OSM software is free and open source, and "
"the data is open for anyone to use. The idea is simple: if you make a map of "
"your town and we make a map of ours, we can share those maps on a common "
"platform. With enough people contributing, we can collect data throughout "
"the world."
