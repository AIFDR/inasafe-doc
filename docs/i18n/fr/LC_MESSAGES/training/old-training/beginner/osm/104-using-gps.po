"A GPS is like a mobile phone, except that instead of receiving radio signals "
"from telephone companies, it receives signals from satellites that are going "

"able to calculate its exact location on the planet. It records this location "
"in coordinates, which are two long numbers. One number tells you how far "
"east or west you are - this is called **longitude**. The second number tells "
"you how far north or south you are - this is called **latitude**. Every "
