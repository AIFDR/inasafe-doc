"A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a system designed to enable people "
"to work with data related to places on the Earth. A GIS allows the creation, "
"storage, manipulation and analysis of geographic data. GIS is a very broad "
"concept and can involve complex hardware and software. But for most peopleâ€™s "
"purposes, a simple GIS software application is all that is required, and in "
"this unit we will learn how to use the excellent open-source application, "
"QGIS."
