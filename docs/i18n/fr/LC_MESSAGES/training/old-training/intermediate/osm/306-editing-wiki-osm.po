"OpenStreetMap is based around a community of mappers working together. "

"main avenue for mappers to do this is through the OSM wiki, a website where "

"The easiest way to add a translation is to go to a page in English, click :"
"guilabel:`Edit`, and copy all of the wiki text to your Clipboard. Then edit "
"the page in your own language, pasting in the original English text and "
"translating it piece by piece. This will allow you to keep all of the "
"original formatting and links correctly, but translate the English text into "
"your own language."
