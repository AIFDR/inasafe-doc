"Relations are also very useful for creating, labeling and editing large "
"linestrings; for example, bus routes, hiking trails, bicycle paths, etc. "
"These differ from multipolygons because they are relations with members, as "
"supposed to complex areas. A linestring could simply be one line with "
"multiple members. Additional features, such as bus stops represented by "
"separate nodes can also be tagged as relation members."
