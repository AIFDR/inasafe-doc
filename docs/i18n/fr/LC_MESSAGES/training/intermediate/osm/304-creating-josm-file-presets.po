"By now you probably have a good understanding of how objects are drawn in "
"JOSM, and how you add information to these objects to describe what they "

"By using the JOSM presets menu, you can easily attach the correct tags to an "
"object by finding the type of object you want to create through a menu, and "
"then filling in information in a form. In this chapter we will review tags "
