"By now you probably have a good understanding of how objects are drawn in "
"JOSM, and how you add information to these objects to describe what they "
"are. You add attributes to a point, line, or shape by attaching tags to it. "
"By using the JOSM presets menu, you can easily attach the correct tags to an "
"object by finding the type of object you want to create through a menu, and "
"then filling in information in a form. In this chapter we will review tags "
"and presets once more, and then learn how we can create our own presets "
