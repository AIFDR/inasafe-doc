"OpenStreetMap is based around a community of mappers working together. "
"Because of this it is necessary to have a way to communicate with each "

"The key avenue for mappers to do this is through the OpenStreetMap wiki, a "

"A wiki is a website where any user can add pages and edit existing pages. It "

"make maps and on how to tag objects on the map, as well as many other OSM "
