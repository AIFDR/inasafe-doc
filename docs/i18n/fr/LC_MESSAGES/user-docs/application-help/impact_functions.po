"An impact function is a software program that computes a impact assessment "
"given a number of inputs. The impact assessment will typically have a "
"*spatial* component (e.g. a GIS layer which can be incorporated into a map) "
"and a *non-spatial* component (e .g. a list of actions you may want to "
"consider carrying out, or a list of estimates of disaster risk reduction "
"elements such as how many bags of rice to make available)."
