"This wizard will lead you through the process of defining keywords for an "
"exposure, hazard or aggregation layer. Unlike the :ref:`keywords editor "
"<keywords_editor>`, the keywords wizard understands the constraints and "
"rules that determine which keywords can be applied to any given layer. For "
"example, if you have a raster layer, the keywords wizard will use impact "
"function metadata to prevent you from declaring that the layer contains road "
"exposure data since by definition, such data must be vector line data."

"Each impact function includes metadata that defines what rules should apply "
