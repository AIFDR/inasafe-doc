"With this tool you can setup numerous scenarios and run them all in one go. "
"A typical use case may be where you define a number of e.g. flood impact "
"scenarios all using a standard dataset e.g. ``flood.shp``. As new flood data "
"becomes available you replace ``flood.shp`` and rerun the scenarios using "
"the batch runner. Using this approach you can quickly produce regional "
"contingency plans as your understanding of hazards changes. When you run the "
"batch of scenarios, pdf reports are generated automatically and all placed "
"in a single common directory making it easy for you to browse and "
"disseminate the reports produced."

"Before running the Batch Runner you might want to use the :ref:"
"`tb_save_scenario` tool to first save some scenarios on which you can let "
"the batch runner do its work. This tool lets you run saved scenarios in one "
"go. It lets you select scenarios or let run all scenarios in one go."
