"In some cases you may wish to create a report containing the combined output "
"of two impact functions for the same area for the **same hazard** but "
"**different exposures**. For example, you may carry out an assessment of the "
"impact of a flood on population and on buildings and combine the results "
"into a single report. The Impact Layer Merge tool allows you to do this."
