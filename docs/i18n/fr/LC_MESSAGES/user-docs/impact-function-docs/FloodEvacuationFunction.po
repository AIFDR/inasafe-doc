"The population subject to inundation exceeding a threshold (default 1m) is "
"calculated and returned as a raster layer. In addition the total number and "
"the required needs in terms of the BNPB (Perka 7) are reported. The "
"threshold can be changed and even contain multiple numbers in which case "
"evacuation and needs are calculated using the largest number with population "
"breakdowns provided for the smaller numbers. The population raster is "
"resampled to the resolution of the hazard raster and is rescaled so that the "
"resampled population counts reflect estimates of population count per "
"resampled cell. The resulting impact layer has the same resolution and "
"reflects population count per cell which are affected by inundation."
