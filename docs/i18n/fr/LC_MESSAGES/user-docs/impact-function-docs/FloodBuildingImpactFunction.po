"The inundation status is calculated for each building (using the centroid if"
" it is a polygon) based on the hazard levels provided. if the hazard is "
"given as a raster a threshold of 1 meter is used. This is configurable "
"through the InaSAFE interface. If the hazard is given as a vector polygon "
"layer buildings are considered to be impacted depending on the value of "
"hazard attributes (in order) \"affected\" or \"FLOODPRONE\": If a building "
"is in a region that has attribute \"affected\" set to True (or 1) it is "
"impacted. If attribute \"affected\" does not exist but \"FLOODPRONE\" does, "
"then the building is considered impacted if \"FLOODPRONE\" is \"yes\". If "
"neither \"affected\" nor \"FLOODPRONE\" is available, a building will be "
"impacted if it belongs to any polygon. The latter behaviour is implemented "
"through the attribute \"inapolygon\" which is automatically assigned."
