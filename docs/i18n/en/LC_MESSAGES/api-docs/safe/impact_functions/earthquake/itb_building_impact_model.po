msgid "Methodology: The ITB vulnerabilty model was heuristically developed (i.e. based on expert opinion) through the Bali workshop. The model is defined with two parameters (median, and lognormal standard deviation) of cumulative lognormal distribution. The building type classification used in the model was endorsed by expert group in thel Bali workshop."
