"InaSAFE supports the use of building data in various impact functions. In "
"particular we support building footprints sourced from the `OpenStreetMap "
"<https://openstreetmap.org>`_ project (OSM). The tool requires internet "
"connection as it fetches the data via a web service running on `Linfiniti's "
"OSM Reporter <http://osm.linfiniti.com>`_ web site."

"The data, once downloaded will be available to you as a shapefile. A style "
"file is automatically created so that it symbolises nicely in QGIS. In "
"addition, the correct keyword metadata is created for the downloaded dataset "
"so that it can be used directly in InaSAFE impact scenario analyses."

"**Note:** The building downloader service has limitations as to the size of "
"datasets that can be retrieved. As such you may experience issues trying to "
"fetch e.g. country wide building footprint data. Generally datasets at a "
"city level and below should work well."
