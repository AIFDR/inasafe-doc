msgid "InaSAFE supports the use of building data in various impact functions. In particular we support building footprints sourced from the `OpenStreetMap <https://openstreetmap.org>`_ project (OSM). The tool requires internet connection as it fetches the data via a web service running on `Linfiniti's OSM Reporter <http://osm.linfiniti.com>`_ web site."
