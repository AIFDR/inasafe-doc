msgid "With this tool you can setup numerous scenarios and run them all in one go. A typical use case may be where you define a number of e.g. flood impact scenarios all using a standard dataset e.g. ``flood.shp``. As new flood data becomes available you replace ``flood.shp`` and rerun the scenarios using the batch runner. Using this approach you can quickly produce regional contingency plans as your understanding of hazards changes. When you run the batch of scenarios, pdf reports are generated automatically and all placed in a single common directory making it easy for you to browse and disseminate the reports produced."

msgid "Before running the Batch Runner you might want to use the :ref:`tb_save_scenario` tool to first save some scenarios on which you can let the batch runner do its work. This tool lets you run saved scenarios in one go. It lets you select scenarios or let run all scenarios in one go."
