msgid "The population subject to inundation exceeding a threshold (default 1m) is calculated and returned as a raster layer. In addition the total number and the required needs in terms of the BNPB (Perka 7) are reported. The threshold can be changed and even contain multiple numbers in which case evacuation and needs are calculated using the largest number with population breakdowns provided for the smaller numbers. The population raster is resampled to the resolution of the hazard raster and is rescaled so that the resampled population counts reflect estimates of population count per resampled cell. The resulting impact layer has the same resolution and reflects population count per cell which are affected by inundation."
