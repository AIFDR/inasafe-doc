"Replacement of prototype earthquake impact system which has been running at "
"BNPB since August 2011. The replacement will address some shortcomings of "
"the prototype to do with appearance of automatically generated map, "
"extensibility and maintenance. The transition to |project_name| also allows "

"Tim Sutton in Q3/Q4 of 2012 and is running at |AIFDR| and |GoA|. Still "
"outstanding is obtaining feedback from |BNPB| on the design and deployment "
