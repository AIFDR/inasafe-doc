"Indonesia experiences a wide range of natural hazards because it is located "
"along major tectonic plate boundaries. It is along these boundaries that the "
"biggest volcanoes and earthquakes happen, including those that cause "
"tsunamis such as the one that devastated many countries in Asia in December "
"2004."

"|BNPB| has identified a priority need to improve Indonesiaâ€™s methodology for "
"contingency planning with an emphasis on the use of realistic disaster "
"scenarios as the starting point for this new, comprehensive process. |BNPB| "
"has been working with the Australia-Indonesia Facility for Disaster "
"Reduction (|AIFDR|) and the World Bank on a methodology and associated "
"software tools for developing realistic disaster scenarios for contingency "
"planning."

"The scenario development methodology has been implemented in an open-source "
"software tool called |project_name| (Indonesia Scenario Assessment For "
"Emergencies). |project_name| is designed to help understand the likely "
"impacts of disasters such as floods, earthquakes or tsunami. It combines "
"spatial data sets representing hazard levels (e.g. ground shaking intensity, "
"water depth, etc.) with information on population, building and "
"infrastructure. The data are collected from scientists, local government and "
"communities; and complemented by external tools such as OpenStreetMap. The "
"software focuses on examining the impact of a single disaster to specific "
"sectors in a certain area to support disaster risk reduction planning based "
"on realistic scenarios. |project_name| provides quantitative information "
"such as:"
