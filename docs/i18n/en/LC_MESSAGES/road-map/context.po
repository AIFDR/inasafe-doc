msgid "Indonesia experiences a wide range of natural hazards because it is located along major tectonic plate boundaries. It is along these boundaries that the biggest volcanoes and earthquakes happen, including those that cause tsunamis such as the one that devastated many countries in Asia in December 2004."

msgid "The scenario development methodology has been implemented in an open-source software tool called |project_name| (Indonesia Scenario Assessment For Emergencies). |project_name| is designed to help understand the likely impacts of disasters such as floods, earthquakes or tsunami. It combines spatial data sets representing hazard levels (e.g. ground shaking intensity, water depth, etc.) with information on population, building and infrastructure. The data are collected from scientists, local government and communities; and complemented by external tools such as OpenStreetMap. The software focuses on examining the impact of a single disaster to specific sectors in a certain area to support disaster risk reduction planning based on realistic scenarios. |project_name| provides quantitative information such as:"
