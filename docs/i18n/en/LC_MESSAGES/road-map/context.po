"Indonesia experiences a wide range of natural hazards because it is located "
"along major tectonic plate boundaries. It is along these boundaries that the "
"biggest volcanoes and earthquakes happen, including those that cause "
"tsunamis such as the one that devastated many countries in Asia in December "
"2004."

"|BNPB| has identified a priority need to improve Indonesiaâ€™s methodology for "
"contingency planning with an emphasis on the use of realistic disaster "
"scenarios as the starting point for this new, comprehensive process. |BNPB| "
"has been working with the Australia-Indonesia Facility for Disaster "
"Reduction (|AIFDR|) and the World Bank on a methodology and associated "
"software tools for developing realistic disaster scenarios for contingency "
"planning."

"The scenario development methodology has been implemented in an open-source "
"software tool called |project_name|. |project_name| is designed to help "
"understand the likely impacts of disasters such as floods, earthquakes or "
"tsunami. It combines spatial data sets representing hazard levels (e.g. "
"ground shaking intensity, water depth, etc.) with information on population, "
"building and infrastructure. The data are collected from scientists, local "
"government and communities; and complemented by external tools such as "
"OpenStreetMap. The software focuses on examining the impact of a single "
"disaster to specific sectors in a certain area to support disaster risk "
"reduction planning based on realistic scenarios. |project_name| provides "
"quantitative information such as:"
