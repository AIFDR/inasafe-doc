The development of contingency plans is seen as an important step to strengthen disaster risk reduction programs.However this can only be effective when contingency plans utilises realistic hazard scenario. Realistic hazard scenarios require scientific, sound and up-to-date data related to sources of hazard and elements of exposure.  Such map-based contingency plans offer accurate and comprehensive results in calculating minimum relief items, identifying safe places, and sectorial planning."
