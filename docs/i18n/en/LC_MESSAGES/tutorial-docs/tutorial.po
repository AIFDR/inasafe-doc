msgid "|project_name| is a plugin for QGIS software. It aims to produce realistic natural hazard impact scenarios for better planning, preparedness and response activities, using hazard and exposure geographic data. A user’s manual developed by Ole Moeller Nielsen and Tim Sutton complements this short training material. During this training, you will explore the different components of |project_name| plugin and their usage for an easy-to-use risk and impact scenarios assessments. A data sample will be provided with the present material to give you the ability to learn how to manipulate data in |project_name|, what the requirements of the data are and what kind of results you can expect out of the data."
