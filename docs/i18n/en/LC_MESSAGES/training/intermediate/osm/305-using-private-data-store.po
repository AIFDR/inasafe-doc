"OpenStreetMap data is open and available to anyone who would like to access "
"it. However, there may be times when you want to use OpenStreetMap to "
"collect data, but you would like to keep some attributes stored in a private "
"database. For this, HOT has developed an additional tool for JOSM known as "
"the SDS (Separate Data Store). The SDS allows you to create maps and add "
"data into JOSM the same as always, but when you upload your edits, public "
"data will be saved to the OpenStreetMap database, and private data will be "
"saved separately to the HOT Datastore."
