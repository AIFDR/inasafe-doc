msgid "OpenStreetMap data is open and available to anyone who would like to access it. However, there may be times when you want to use OpenStreetMap to collect data, but you would like to keep some attributes stored in a private database. For this, HOT has developed an additional tool for JOSM known as the SDS (Separate Data Store). The SDS allows you to create maps and add data into JOSM the same as always, but when you upload your edits, public data will be saved to the OpenStreetMap database, and private data will be saved separately to the HOT Datastore."
