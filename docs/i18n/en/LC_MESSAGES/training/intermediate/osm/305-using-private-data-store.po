"OpenStreetMap data is open and available to anyone who would like to access "

"this purpose, HOT has developed a tool for JOSM known as the Separate Data "
"Store. The SDS allows you to create maps and add data into JOSM the same as "
"always, but when you upload your edits, public data is saved to the OSM "
"database and private data is saved separately to your private data server."
