"Contributing to OpenStreetMap is easy to learn, but difficult to master. "
"Everybody makes mistakes, but the system works because even when one person "
"does something the “wrong” way, there are always other mappers ready to help "
"and fix errors. As you map more and more, it will continue to get easier, "
"and you will learn the “proper” way to do things. In this chapter we will "
"take a look at the JOSM validation tool, which is an automated tool to "
"search for errors and warnings in your data. We will also take a look at one "
"of the online validation tools, which can aid us further in identifying "
"mistakes on OpenStreetMap."
