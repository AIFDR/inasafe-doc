"Contributing to OpenStreetMap is easy to learn, but difficult to master. "
"Everybody makes mistakes, but the system works because even when one person "
"does something the “wrong” way, there are always other mappers ready to help "
"and fix errors. As you map more and more it will continue to get easier, and "
"you will learn the “proper” way to do things. In this module we will take a "
"look at the JOSM validation tool, which is an automated tool to search for "
"errors and warnings in your data. We will also take a look at one of the "
"online validation tools, which can aid us further in identifying mistakes on "
