msgid "Contributing to OpenStreetMap is easy to learn, but difficult to master. Everybody makes mistakes, but the system works because even when one person does something the “wrong” way, there are always other mappers ready to help and fix errors. As you map more and more, it will continue to get easier, and you will learn the “proper” way to do things. In this chapter we will take a look at the JOSM validation tool, which is an automated tool to search for errors and warnings in your data. We will also take a look at one of the online validation tools, which can aid us further in identifying mistakes on OpenStreetMap."

To help address this, HOT has developed an OpenStreetMap Tasking Tool to make it easier for administrators to define the areas of mapping interest and to delegate workers. The idea behind this tool is that if there is an area, let’s say a city, that we want to map, and we have some people mapping on the ground, and some people mapping remotely using satellite imagery, this tool will allow us to create a grid of the entire area. Collaborators can select blocks in the grid that they plan to map, and when they finish, they can mark that area as complete. In this way a team of many people can coordinate to map the entire grid."

This mistake is commonly made with buildings and landuse polygons.  For example, a polygon drawn to represent a park outside a building should not overlap with the building.  Instead it should be drawn next to the building. There are some exceptions to this rule, such as schools.  Within a school yard you might identify individual buildings using polygons, yet you also might want to create a polygon around the entire school yard.  In this case it is fine for the polygons to overlap, but the rule to follow here is to make sure that the buildings are completely inside the landuse polygon."
