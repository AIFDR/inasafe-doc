"A common error is to have overlapping polygons when the objects they "
"represent do not overlap in real life. A building cannot overlap another "
"building. This mistake is commonly made with buildings and landuse polygons. "
"For example, a polygon drawn to represent a park outside a building should "
"not overlap with the building. Instead it should be drawn next to the "
"building."

"OSM can do amazing things with identifying where objects end and what labels "
