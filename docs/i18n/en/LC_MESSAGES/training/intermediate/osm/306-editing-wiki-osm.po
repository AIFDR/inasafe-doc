msgid "OpenStreetMap is based around a community of mappers working together. Because of this it is necessary to have a way to communicate with each other, whether it be to organize social mapping events, to discuss different projects related to OSM and/or to create standards for mapping processes. The key avenue for mappers to do this is through the OpenStreetMap wiki, a website where users can create different web pages about different topics and in different languages. To see the OSM wiki, visit http://wiki.openstreetmap.org"

It is based on the same principle as OpenStreetMap, the only difference is that with OSM users are editing maps, while wiki users are editing text. The most famous wiki is Wikipedia (http://www.wikipedia.org), an online encyclopedia that covers almost every topic imaginable."

You have already seen at least one of the OSM wiki pages, which describes all of the most common features that you can add to the map, and how they are commonly tagged.
