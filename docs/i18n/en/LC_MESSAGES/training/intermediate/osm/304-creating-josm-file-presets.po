msgid "By now you probably have a good understanding of how objects are drawn in JOSM, and how you add information to these objects to describe what they are. You add attributes to a point, line, or shape by attaching tags to it. By using the JOSM presets menu, you can easily attach the correct tags to an object by finding the type of object you want to create through a menu, and then filling in information in a form. In this chapter we will review tags and presets once more, and then learn how we can create our own presets menus to use in JOSM."

It is impossible to remember all of these tags, and quite a hassle to look them up every time you need them.

With the Presets menu, we can easily find the entry for school, enter information into a form, and not have to worry about whether the correct tag is **amenity=school** or **education=school** or something else entirely."

The key difference is that XML is designed to carry **data**, not display it. Many applications on the internet use XML to transmit data, including OpenStreetMap. XML uses **elements**, and each element can contain child elements inside it. For example, let’s imagine that we want to create an XML file that contains data about a restaurant menu. We must create a **root element** to contain all the data about our menu. Our root element will have an opening and a closing tag, like this: ::"
