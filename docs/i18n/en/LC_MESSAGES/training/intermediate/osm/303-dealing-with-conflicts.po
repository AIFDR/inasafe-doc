"downloaded Node A, changed it, and saved the changes back on OpenStreetMap. "
"Now when you try to upload your version of Node A, it is different from the "
"one saved on OSM. Therefore JOSM doesn’t know which version of Node A should "

"The process of resolving a conflict is quite simple, although it can appear "
