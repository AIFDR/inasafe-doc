"What happened is that you downloaded a bunch of data, which included a point "
"which we will call Node A. Then while you were editing, somebody else also "
"downloaded Node A, changed it, and saved the changes back on OpenStreetMap. "
"Now when you try to upload your version of Node A, it is different from the "
"one saved on OSM. Therefore JOSM doesn’t know which version of Node A should "

"The process of resolving a conflict is quite simple, although it can appear "
"quite confusing at first in JOSM. Basically, for every conflict JOSM will "
"present you with two choices - your version of an object and the one that is "
"on the server. You need to choose whether to keep your version, or whether "
"the new version on the server should remain."

"Perhaps while you were busy editing, another mapper added a lot of "
"information to one of the nodes in your data set. If you choose your version "
"over their version, you will lose all of that valuable information that they "
"added. Hence you should consider keeping their version, or merging it with "
"your own."
