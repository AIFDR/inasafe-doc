"What happened is that you downloaded a bunch of data, which included a point "
"which we will call Node A. Then while you were editing, somebody else also "
"downloaded Node A, changed it, and saved the changes back on OpenStreetMap. "
"Now when you try to upload your version of Node A, it is different from the "
"one saved on OSM. Therefore JOSM doesn’t know which version of Node A should "

"The process of resolving a conflict is quite simple, although it can appear "
"quite confusing at first in JOSM. Basically, for every conflict JOSM will "

"the new version on the server should remain."
