msgid "What happened is that you downloaded a bunch of data, which included a point which we will call Node A. Then while you were editing, somebody else also downloaded Node A, changed it, and saved the changes back on OpenStreetMap. Now when you try to upload your version of Node A, it is different from the one saved on OSM. Therefore JOSM doesn’t know which version of Node A should be saved."

msgid "The process of resolving a conflict is quite simple, although it can appear quite confusing at first in JOSM. Basically, for every conflict JOSM will present you with two choices - your version of an object and the one that is on the server. You need to choose whether to keep your version, or whether the new version on the server should remain."

msgid "You might think, “of course my version is going to be better!”. And maybe you’re right. But think back to our example at the start of this chapter. Perhaps while you were busy editing, another mapper added a lot of information to one of the nodes in your data set. If you choose your version over their version, you will lose all of that valuable information that they added. Hence you should consider keeping their version, or merging it with your own."
