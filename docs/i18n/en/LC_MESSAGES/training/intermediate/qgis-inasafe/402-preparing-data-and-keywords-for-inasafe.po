"When we are working in InaSAFE, hazard data refers to a vector or raster "
"dataset that represents the level and magnitude of an event that can "
"potentially cause damages. To be used for impact calculation in InaSAFE, "
"level and magnitude of an event scenario must be mapped over the area of "
"interest. This means that hazard data must be geographic - it must have "
"location.  We have already looked at hazard data for the 2007 Jakarta Flood "
"and the Lembang Earthquake. These hazard layers were produced from "
"scientific modeling conducted by scientific organizations and government "
"agencies. These are typical sources for such hazard data, although in cases "
"of flood hazards such data may also be gathered from affected communities."
