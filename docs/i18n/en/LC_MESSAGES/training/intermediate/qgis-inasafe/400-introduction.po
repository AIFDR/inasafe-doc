"Free, collaborative maps are uniquely valuable to humanitarian work, "
"especially in places where base map data is often scarce, out of date, or "
"rapidly changing. OpenStreetMap is a web project to create a free and open "
"map of the entire world, built entirely by volunteers surveying with GPS, "
"digitizing aerial imagery, and collecting and liberating existing public "
"sources of geographic data. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is an "
"initiative to apply the principles and activities of open source and open "
"data sharing towards humanitarian response and economic development."

"First, we will undertake a review of unit 2, to ensure that we remember all "
"the QGIS skills that we studied. Then we will begin working on another "
"InaSAFE project using flood data as our hazard. We will consider the best "
"possible evacuation routes and locations for IDP camps, calculate damages "
"and losses and learn how to display them on a map."
