OpenStreetMap is a web project to create a free and open map of the entire world, built entirely by volunteers surveying with GPS, digitizing aerial imagery, and collecting and liberating existing public sources of geographic data. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is an initiative to apply the principles and activities of open source and open data sharing towards humanitarian response and economic development."

Then we will begin working on another InaSAFE project using flood data as our hazard. We will consider the best possible evacuation routes and locations for IDP camps, calculate damages and losses and learn how to display them on a map."
