msgid "Free, collaborative maps are uniquely valuable to humanitarian work, especially in places where base map data is often scarce, out of date, or rapidly changing. OpenStreetMap is a web project to create a free and open map of the entire world, built entirely by volunteers surveying with GPS, digitizing aerial imagery, and collecting and liberating existing public sources of geographic data. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is an initiative to apply the principles and activities of open source and open data sharing towards humanitarian response and economic development."
