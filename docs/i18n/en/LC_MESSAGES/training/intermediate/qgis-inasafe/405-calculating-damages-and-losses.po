The standard DaLA methodology was developed by the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (UN-ECLAC) in 1972, and has evolved with various international organizations since. Simply, it is a methodology for approximating damage and losses due to a disaster, basing calculations on a country’s economy and individual livelihoods to define the needs for recovery and reconstruction."
