"By now you should have a pretty good understanding of how InaSAFE works and "
"its operations. You know how to add the appropriate layers, and how to "
"define keywords to the layers so that InaSAFE can recognize them "
"appropriately. Now that we can use InaSAFE effectively to run scenario "
"analyses, we will look at other QGIS functionality that will help us in "
"preparing contingency plans. In this Module, we will learn how to perform a "
"GIS analysis in order to determine an appropriate evacuation route in the "
"event of a disaster."

"The term **fastest route** indicates the route a person can take between "
"point A and point B that will allow them to cover the distance in the least "
"amount of time. Similarly, shortest path indicates the route that will allow "
"a person to get from point A to point B with the least distance traveled. In "
"theory, this would be a straight line between point A and point B, but in "
"reality this is impractical, because traveling in a straight lines means "
"climbing hills and going around buildings and fences.  Of course this is why "
"we use roads, and why we calculate fastest and shortest routes using roads. "
"We will use the Road Graph plugin in this Module, which does just that. If "
"we provide two points, the plugin is able to calculate either the fastest "
"route or the shortest path between them."
