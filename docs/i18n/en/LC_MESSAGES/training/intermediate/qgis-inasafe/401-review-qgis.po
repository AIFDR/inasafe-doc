"As you may recall, there are two types of data that we often use in QGIS: "
"raster data and vector data. Raster data is characterized as an array of "
"data which consists of rows and columns, like the pixels in an image. Vector "
"data, on the other hand, consists of discrete features made of points and "
"lines, and their position is defined by coordinates."
