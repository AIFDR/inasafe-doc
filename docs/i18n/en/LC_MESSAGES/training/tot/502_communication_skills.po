msgid "Linear communication model is a process that consists of two straight lines, where the communication process starts from the communicator and ends at the communicant. The circular model of communication, on the other hand, is a communication process that not only starts from the communicator and ends at the communicant, but also pays attention to the feedback from the communicant, making the model a full circle process. This means that the trainer can be the source of information at one time and the recipient at another time, vice versa. Participants can be the recipient of information but also the source of information. So communication is a simultaneous notice or exchange. The communication process as mentioned above can be seen below."
