In other words, when we go mapping to collect locations and facts about those locations, we have collected data - we have collected facts.  To turn this data into information, we must make sense of it.  We must present the data in such a way that it can be easily understood."

The map that you see when you visit the OSM website is there because a computer has processed all of the OSM data and used it to paint a nice looking map.

msgid "A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a system designed to enable people to work with data related to places on the Earth.  A GIS allows the creation, storage, manipulation, and analysis of geographic data.  GIS is a very broad concept and can involve complex hardware and software.  But for most people's purposes, a simple GIS software application is all that is required, and in this unit we will learn how to use the excellent open-source application, Quantum GIS."

It enables us to ask complex questions, such as: * *where are all schools with more than 100 students?* * *how many children live in a certain district?* * *How many women live within 500 meters of a certain hospital?* * *What is the shortest walking path from a given point to a hospital?*"

msgid "GIS has an important role in contingency planning.  A contingency plan is intended to support community preparedness to anticipate the arrival of a potentially hazardous event, such as an earthquake or tsunami. [a] The purpose of such a plan is to minimize casualties and losses in case of such an event."

A good plan will likely answer questions such as: * *what sort of disaster would be likely to happen?* * *how widespread will the impact be?* * *who is responsible for helping?* * *what can be given as aid?* * *where are the priority areas?*"

msgid "A Geographic Information System is able to help planners answer these questions, especially the important spatial elements of contingency planning.  GIS may be used to model hazardous events so that they can be better predicted and reduce risk.  It may be used to plan evacuation routes prior to a disaster.  When a disaster occurs, GIS may also play a role in the emergency response phase.  It can be used to map the area affected and position of refugee camps, so that helpers can be directed to the most useful locations to aid those affected.  After a disaster, GIS may also be used to plan for rehabilitation and reconstruction.  Overall, GIS helps to perform analysis of a disaster, damage and losses caused, and opportunities for reducing risk."

msgid "The Importance of Data We previously learned how to start collecting exposure data.  When thinking about GIS it is important to remember that if your data is bad, your analysis will be bad also.  Hence the more detailed and accurate your data is, the better your analysis and action may be during a disaster."

msgid "As we shall see in this unit, some data may be obtained from various agencies that specialize in certain kinds of data.  For example, we will obtain our hazard models (hazard data) from various organizations that specialize in this.  As for exposure data, some data we may find through agencies, such as population data.  For ever important infrastructure data, collecting data at a community level is key, which is why in the previous unit we learned how to utilize the crowd-sourced OpenStreetMap platform."

If you think a feature is missing, you can sponsor the development of a feature, or add it yourself if you are familiar with programming. 3. It's constantly developing and improving.  Because many people continue adding features, it keeps getting better. 4. Extensive help and documentation is available.  If you have problems you can always turn to the software documentation, other QGIS users, or even the developers."

One of these plugins is InaSAFE, which can be used to analyze the impact of a disaster and create a list of actions needed to be taken when a disaster occurs.  QGIS and InaSAFE can also help to determine the location of ideal places of refuge, evacuation routes, areas likely to be damaged, and more."
