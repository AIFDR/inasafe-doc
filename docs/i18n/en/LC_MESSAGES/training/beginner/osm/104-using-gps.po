msgid "A GPS is like a mobile phone, except that instead of receiving radio signals from telephone companies, it receives signals from satellites that are going around the Earth. By receiving these signals from the satellites, a GPS is able to calculate your exact location on the planet.  It records this location in coordinates, which are two long numbers.  One number tells you how far East or West you are - this is called **longitude**.  The second number tells you how far North or South you are - this is called **latitude**. Every place on Earth has unique geographic coordinates."
