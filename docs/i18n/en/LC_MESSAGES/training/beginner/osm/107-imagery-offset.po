msgid "Using aerial imagery is the most widely used approach in making maps with OpenStreetMap.  Mappers typically use Bing satellite as a background layer while making their maps, or imagery from another provider.  We have already seen this in action.  In this module we will learn a little bit more about aerial imagery, and we will learn how to solve the one important problem of using aerial photographs - imagery offset."

msgid "At first, the satellite image is a combination of photographs and satellite coordinates. Special software is used to calculate each side of the photographs. In general, satellite images have high resolution enables more accurate calculation. But there are thousands of photographs and the surface of the earth is not a perfect circle ellipsoid. Satellite imagery provider can not verify the accuracy of each photo, so the coordinates can be shifted from the actual position. That is why satellite imagery can be shifted 1-2 meters and sometimes up to hundreds of meters. In the mountainous or hilly areas, satellite imagery often has a non-linear distortion. Shift or distortion is called imagery offset / shift satellite imagery."

Bing Aerial Imagery is made up of satellite photos."

Measurement is important with aerial photographs - hence, a pixel represents a certain distance on the ground.  We usually describe imagery as something like \"two meter resolution imagery\", which means that one pixel is equivalent to two meters on the ground.  One meter resolution imagery would have a higher resolution than this, and 50cm resolution would be higher still. This is generally the range of imagery that is provided by Bing, though it varies between locations, and in many places it is worse than two meters, at which point it becomes difficult to identify objects in the image."

This is particularly true in hilly or mountainous areas, where it can be difficult to stretch a flat image over an area of the Earth with many contours.  When you load imagery in JOSM, it can sometimes be ten meters or more from its true position.  This is called imagery offset."

msgid "We’ve learned about two major ways of making maps - one is by utilizing aerial imagery to identify features on the ground, and another is by using GPS to record tracks and waypoints and then add them to OpenStreetMap.  The advantage of aerial imagery is obvious.  It enables you, the mapper, to see the whole picture, to observe various details from the image, consider your knowledge of the area, and easily trace roads, buildings, and areas.  One key advantage of GPS however, is that it doesn’t suffer from offset like imagery.  A GPS will always provide you with a correct latitude and longitude.  The only exception is when the satellite signals are interrupted by tall buildings or mountains, but in this case it is easy to recognize the error.  Observe the GPS trace in this image, compared with the Bing aerial imagery layer beneath it:"
