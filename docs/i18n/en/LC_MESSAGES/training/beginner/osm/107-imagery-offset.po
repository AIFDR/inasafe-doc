Mappers typically use Bing satellite as a background layer while making their maps, or imagery from another provider.  We have already seen this in action.  In this module we will learn a little bit more about aerial imagery, and we will learn how to solve the one important problem of using aerial photographs - imagery offset."

"At first, the satellite image is a combination of photographs and satellite "
"coordinates. Special software is used to calculate each side of the "
"photographs. In general, satellite images have high resolution enables more "
"accurate calculation. But there are thousands of photographs and the surface "
"of the earth is not a perfect circle ellipsoid. Satellite imagery provider "
"can not verify the accuracy of each photo, so the coordinates can be shifted "
"from the actual position. That is why satellite imagery can be shifted 1-2 "
"meters and sometimes up to hundreds of meters. In the mountainous or hilly "
"areas, satellite imagery often has a non-linear distortion. Shift or "
"distortion is called imagery offset / shift satellite imagery."
