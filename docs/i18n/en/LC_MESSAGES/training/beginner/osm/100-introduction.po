OpenStreetMap is a web project to create a free and open map of the entire world, built entirely by volunteers surveying with GPS, digitizing aerial imagery, and collecting and liberating existing public sources of geographic data. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (|HOT|) is an initiative to apply the principles and activities of open source and open data sharing towards humanitarian response and economic development."

Most OSM software is free and open source, and the data is open for anyone to use. The idea is simple: if you make a map of your town and I make a map of mine, we can share those maps on a common platform. With enough people contributing, we can make maps and collect data throughout the world."
