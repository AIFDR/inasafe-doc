"Free, collaborative maps are uniquely valuable to humanitarian work, "

"Every day thousands of people contribute to OpenStreetMap, a project with "
"the lofty goal of mapping the world. Most OSM software is free and open "
"source, and the data is open for anyone to use. The idea is simple: if you "
"make a map of your town and I make a map of mine, we can share those maps on "
"a common platform. With enough people contributing, we can make maps and "
"collect data throughout the world."
