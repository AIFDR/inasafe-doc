msgid "Maps are a good way to convey information. Maps are visual representations of our world. They can often demonstrate an idea better than words.  This in turn can also help answer important questions.  Where is the closest school or hospital?  Who has the least access to these facilities?  Where is poverty the most problematic? Questions like these can often best be expressed with maps, and maps can help find solutions to these questions."

msgid "If your town is like most, you may have drawn some lines to represent roads, possibly a river or stream. Perhaps you added important buildings such as schools and offices, fields, or boundaries.  Whatever you drew, you probably used symbols - a line to symbolize a road, a square to symbolize a building, and so on. Your map is a representation of what is on the ground."

msgid "Your map is informative.  You might use a map like this to explain to someone where different places are, where problems are in your community, or merely to help someone find their way around. The uses of your map is limited though. There is only one copy of the map and the way you drew it may make sense to you, but perhaps not to someone else who would have drawn their own map in a different way. Because your map is merely on paper, it is difficult to get that information to others. This is why making your map on a computer, in such a way that anyone can access it, can be much more valuable."

msgid "Mapmaking on computers allows us to collect more useful data than on paper. On paper we might draw a school, and even add it’s name and record some information about the school, but on the computer we can attach an endless amount of data about the school, such as the number of students, number of teachers, size of the building, type of structure, and so on. And more importantly, when we add this school to a digital map, we record it’s precise location (longitude and latitude) on the planet. This is invaluable for our future mapmaking and analysis, and we will look more closely at it later on."

msgid "OpenStreetMap is a tool for creating and sharing map information. Anyone can contribute to OSM, and thousands of people add to the project every day. Users draw maps on computers, rather than paper, but as we will see in this guide, drawing a map on a computer is not all that different from drawing on paper. We still draw lines to represent roads, fields, and anything else, and we still represent schools and hospitals with symbols. The important thing is that OSM maps are saved on the internet, and anyone can access them at any time, totally free."

The basic idea is this: if you make a map of your street and I make a map of my street, and then more people make maps of their streets, we all can share these maps and this data on a common platform, and use the data for our own projects."

msgid "In the optional module at the start of this training, we used a file that contained buildings in Jakarta.  This data came from OpenStreetMap. While no single person could have mapped 13,000 buildings, many different people contributing just a little bit at a time provided us with a data file that allows us to do very impressive analysis, and help an entire community prepare for the next time there is a flood.  In this sense, the work is somehow cyclical. The community contributes data so that emergency managers can design highly effective contingency plans, and those plans may then be used to benefit the community at large. And the more data that the community provides, the better the contingency planning can be."
