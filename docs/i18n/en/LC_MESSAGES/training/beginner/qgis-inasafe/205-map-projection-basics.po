"To understand why, think about a globe of the Earth. It has lines running "

"earth on a flat surface, it becomes distorted, as if you took an orange peel "
"and tried to flatten it.  What this means on a map is that the longitude "
"lines stay equally far apart from each other, even at the poles (where they "
"are supposed to meet). This means that, as you travel away from the equator "
"on your map, the scale of the objects that you see gets larger and larger. "
