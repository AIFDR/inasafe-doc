msgid "Thus far we’ve worked mostly with vector data, which consists of features, and these features are themselves made up of points and lines.  In this chapter we will learn about raster data.  Remember when you were editing OpenStreetMap in JOSM? The points, lines and shapes that you drew were vector data. But when you loaded Bing aerial imagery in the background, that was raster data. So what’s the difference?"

msgid "Raster data essentially comes in the form of an image.  It is made up of pixels, like a photograph, and a raster image will always be some number of pixels wide and some number of pixels high.  If you zoom in far enough on a raster image, it will start to become blurry, just as if you opened a photo on your computer and zoomed in very close.  As we’ll see in this chapter, however, a raster image can mean more than just a photograph from the sky. Follow along and we’ll learn all about rasters!"

For our aerial image, this is already defined.  Since it is a normal image, it knows to associate the numbers for each pixel in the file with the common colors that we see every day.  But this new raster image is different, because the values of each pixel don’t represent colors, but rather altitude, and QGIS doesn’t know automatically how to display it. Hence it shows every pixel in the image as gray, even if the values in each pixel are different.  When we change the symbology to Psuedocolor, we can see all the different pixel values shown with various colors."

msgid "Using a hillshade in this way, it’s possible to enhance the topography of the landscape. If the effect doesn’t seem strong enough to you, you can change the transparency of the hillshade layer; but of course, the brighter the hillshade becomes, the dimmer the colors behind it will be. You will need to find a balance that works for you."
