In other words, when we go mapping to collect locations and facts about those locations, we have collected data - we have collected facts.  To turn this data into information, we must make sense of it.  We must present the data in such a way that it can be easily understood."

msgid "A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a system designed to enable people to work with data related to places on the Earth.  A GIS allows the creation, storage, manipulation, and analysis of geographic data.  GIS is a very broad concept and can involve complex hardware and software.  But for most peopleâ€™s purposes, a simple GIS software application is all that is required, and in this unit we will learn how to use the excellent open-source application, Quantum GIS."
