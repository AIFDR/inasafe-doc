msgid "QGIS has core functionality, which we will continue to explore in this guide, but it also allows the use of additional plugins, which allow you to add functionality to the software. Again, these plugins are free. To use them, you simply need to connect to the internet and install. In this chapter we will learn how to install QGIS plugins, using one plugin to add a satellite imagery layer to our QGIS project. If you have closed QGIS since completing the previous chapter, start it again and open up the project that you saved at the end of the chapter. If you didn’t save where we left off, don’t worry, simply open the project :file:`named sleman_2_3.qgs` in the :file:`qgis/ folder`."
