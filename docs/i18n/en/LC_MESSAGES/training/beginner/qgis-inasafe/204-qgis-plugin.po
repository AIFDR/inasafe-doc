"QGIS has core functionality, which we will continue to explore in this "
"guide, but it also allows the use of additional plugins, which allow you to "
"add functionality to the software. Again, these plugins are free. To use "
"them, you simply need to connect to the internet and install. In this "
"chapter we will learn how to install QGIS plugins, using one plugin to add a "
"satellite imagery layer to our QGIS project. If you have closed QGIS since "
"completing the previous chapter, start it again and open up the project that "
"you saved at the end of the chapter. If you didn’t save where we left off, "
"don’t worry, simply open the project :file:`named sleman_2_3.qgs` in the :"
"file:`qgis/ folder`."
