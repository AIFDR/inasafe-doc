msgid "As one of the most hazard-prone and densely populated countries in the world, Indonesia faces significant risk of loss of lives and challenges to development progress as a result of natural disasters. The development of contingency plans is seen as an important step to strengthen disaster risk reduction programs. However this can only be effective when contingency plans utilises realistic hazard scenario. Realistic hazard scenarios require scientific, sound and up-to-date data hazard information as well as up-to-date, scale appropriate exposure.  Such map-based contingency plans offer accurate and comprehensive results in calculating minimum relief items, identifying safe places, and sectorial planning."
