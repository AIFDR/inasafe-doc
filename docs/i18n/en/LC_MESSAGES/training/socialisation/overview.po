"As one of the most hazard-prone and densely populated countries in the "
"world, Indonesia faces significant risk of loss of lives and challenges to "
"development progress as a result of natural disasters. The development of "
"contingency plans is seen as an important step to strengthen disaster risk "
"reduction programs. However this can only be effective when contingency "
"plans utilise realistic hazard scenario. Realistic hazard scenarios require "
"scientific, sound and up-to-date data hazard information as well as up-to-"
"date, scale appropriate exposure information. Such map-based contingency "
"plans offer accurate and comprehensive results in calculating minimum relief "
"items, identifying safe places, and sectorial planning."
