msgid "Vector data is arguably the most common kind of data you will find in the daily use of GIS. It describes geographic data in terms of points, that may be connected into lines and polygons. Every object in a vector dataset is called a feature, and is associated with data that describes that feature."

msgid "Raster data is quite different from vector data. Vector data has discrete features constructed out of vertices, and perhaps connected with lines and/or areas. Raster data, however, is like an image. Although it may portray various properties of objects in the real world, these objects donâ€™t exist as separate objects; rather, they are represented using pixels of various different colour values."

msgid "Basically, Vector data is like using a pen, where you can draw a point, a line or a polygon, Raster data is like taking a picture with a camera, where each square has one value, and all the squares (pixels) combine to make a picture."
