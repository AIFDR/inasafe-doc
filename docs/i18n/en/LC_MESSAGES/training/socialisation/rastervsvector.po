"Vector data is arguably the most common kind of data you will find in the "
"daily use of GIS. It describes geographic data in terms of points, that may "
"be connected into lines and polygons. Every object in a vector dataset is "
"called a feature, and is associated with data that describes that feature."

"Raster data is different from vector data. Vector data has discrete features "
"constructed out of vertices, and perhaps connected with lines and/or areas. "
"Raster data, however, is like an image. Although it may portray various "
"properties of objects in the real world, these objects donâ€™t exist as "
"separate objects; rather, they are represented using pixels of various "
"different colour values."

"Vector data is like using a pen, where you can draw a point, a line or a "
"polygon, Raster data is like taking a picture with a camera, where each "
"square has one value, and all the squares (pixels) combine to make a picture."

"Both vector and raster data can be used in InaSAFE and will be used in this "
"tutorial. The footprint (area) of a hazard may be represented using vectors, "
"as well as the shapes and locations of buildings. A hazard model may also be "
"represented by raster data. Population density is also represented using "
"rasters. We will see all of these in this tutorial."
