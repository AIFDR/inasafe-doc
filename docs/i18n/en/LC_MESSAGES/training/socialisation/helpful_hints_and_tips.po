"project_name| functionality chapter (page 13), you are able to get open "
"exposure data from  www.asiapop.org for population and  from OpenStreetMap "
"for structures (however you may need to still digitise the structures go to "
"www.learnosm.org for more details). To download OSM data see Appendix :"
"guilabel:`Getting OpenStreetMap Data` (page 56). For hazard information it "
"is best to approach your government science agencies or local universities "
"to model earthquake, tsunami or floods. However if it floods regularly in "
"your region you could also develop a community flood-prone footprint."
