Hence understanding the structure of the building and how they may act under certain shaking is crucial in understanding the impact of an earthquake. Unfortunately  earthquakes cover a large area, so mapping every structure in that area is extensive.  In Padang the international OpenStreetMap community assisted mapping, totalling roughly 95,000 structures."
