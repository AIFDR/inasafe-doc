msgid "As we are all aware, its generally not the earthquake that kills its the collapsing buildings that kill the majority of the people. Hence understanding the structure of the building and how they may act under certain shaking is crucial in understanding the impact of an earthquake. Unfortunately  earthquakes cover a large area, so mapping every structure in that area is extensive.  In Padang the international OpenStreetMap community assisted mapping, totalling roughly 95,000 structures."
