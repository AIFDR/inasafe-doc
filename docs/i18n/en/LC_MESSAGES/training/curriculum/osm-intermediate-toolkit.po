"When conducting a workshop of OpenStreetMap, many factors must be "
"considered, including how much time and resources owned, number of "
"participants, and the technical capabilities of the participants themselves. "
"This guide will help you to prepare workshop with different types of "
"participants. However, this all assumes that participants for Intermediate "
"workshop has had experience working with the OSM. Some participants may be "
"more adept than the others, and at this intermediate level workshop, You "
"will likely see a bigger gap on this training in terms of ability and "
"experience of the participants. Remember, it is important to keep the "
"participant who has been adept at OpenStreetMap materials, but also not to "
"leave participants who have not been too adept. Placing participants in "
"pairs sometimes can be a good idea, that where one participant has been more "
"proficient and her partner are still not proficient."
