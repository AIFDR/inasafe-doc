===================
Strategic Objective
===================

The next 6 months of |project_name|â€™s development aims at the following high
level objectives:

#. To get |project_name| to a state that it can be used by BPBD for
   pre-disaster planning. This is essentially addressed by the listed user
   requirements.
#. Be ready to convert to QGIS2.0 (including training material).
#. Make it easier for beginner developers to join the development of
   |project_name|.

Out of scope are items like:

* Post disaster modelling
* International Capability
* New interesting impact functions unless strictly required by Objective 1
