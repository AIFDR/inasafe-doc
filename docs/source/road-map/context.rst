Context
=======

Indonesia experiences a wide range of natural hazards because it is located
along major tectonic plate boundaries. It is along these boundaries that the
biggest volcanoes and earthquakes happen, including those that cause tsunamis
such as the one that devastated many countries in Asia in December 2004.

BNPB has identified a priority need to improve Indonesiaâ€™s methodology for
contingency planning with an emphasis on the use of realistic disaster
scenarios as the starting point for this new, comprehensive process.
BNPB has been working with the Australia-Indonesia Facility for Disaster
Reduction (|AIFDR|) and the World Bank on a methodology and associated
software tools for developing realistic disaster scenarios for contingency
planning.

Background
----------

The scenario development methodology has been implemented in an open-source
software tool called |project_name| (Indonesia Scenario Assessment For
Emergencies).
|project_name| is designed to help understand the likely impacts of disasters
such as floods, earthquakes or tsunami. It combines spatial data sets
representing hazard levels (e.g. ground shaking intensity, water depth,
etc.) with information on population, building and infrastructure. The data
are collected from scientists, local government and communities; and
complemented by external tools such as OpenStreetMap. The software focuses
on examining the impact of a single disaster to specific sectors in a
certain area to support disaster risk reduction planning based on realistic
scenarios. |project_name| provides quantitative information such as:

* Areas affected by the hazard.
* Number of people affected.
* Number of people needing to be evacuated.
* Which schools, government offices and other public facilities that may be
  closed.
* Which hospitals can still take patients.
* Where roads may be closed.
* Which buildings/open areas are not affected and could be utilised as
  evacuation centres.

|project_name| is based on the well established Open Source project QGIS
(Quantum Geographical Information System) and is designed to

* be easy to use
* allow results to be reproduced
* ensure consistency across different locations and scenarios
* provide a platform for near real time impact estimates such as predicted
  fatalities based on earthquake ground shaking.

To date, the approaches at the heart of |project_name| have been developed
and piloted as guided by the 2012 |project_name| Project Plan.
