Raster vs. Vector
-----------------

Vector
.......

Vector data is arguably the most common kind of data you will find in the daily use
of GIS. It describes geographic data in terms of points, that may be connected into
lines and polygons. Every object in a vector dataset is called a feature, and is
associated with data that describes that feature.

Raster
......

Raster data is different from vector data. Vector data has discrete features
constructed out of vertices, and perhaps connected with lines and/or areas. Raster
data, however, is like an image. Although it may portray various properties of objects
in the real world, these objects donâ€™t exist as separate objects; rather, they are
represented using pixels of various different colour values.

.. note:: Vector data is like using a pen, where you can draw a
   point, a line or a polygon, Raster data is like taking a picture with a
   camera, where each square has one value, and all the squares (pixels)
   combine to make a picture.

Both vector and raster data can be used in InaSAFE and will be used in this tutorial.
The footprint (area) of a hazard may be represented using vectors, as well as the shapes
and locations of buildings. A hazard model may also be represented by raster data. Population
density is also represented using rasters. We will see all of these in this tutorial.
