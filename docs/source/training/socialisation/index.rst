Socialisation
=============

This training course is designed to have hands on experience with
|project_name|.
It is not designed as a comprehensive course (we are still currently working
on those), but to give participants an idea of what |project_name| is capable
of doing.
The course is scheduled to only run for 1/2 day.

The data used in this course is available for download on
`data.inasafe.org <http://data.inasafe.org/>`_.
Ask your trainer which data you will need to download or your trainer will
give you the data on a USB-Stick anyway.
