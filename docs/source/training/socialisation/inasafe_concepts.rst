Key concepts in disaster management planning with |project_name|
----------------------------------------------------------------
In this section we explain the basic concepts of |project_name| and the merits
of disaster management planning.

**Risk assessment:**  *“A methodology to determine the nature and extent of risk
by analysing potential hazards and evaluating existing conditions of
vulnerability that together could potentially harm exposed people, property,
services, livelihoods and the environment on which they depend. ”*

**Contingency planning:**  *“A management process that analyses specific
potential events or emerging situations that might threaten society or the
environment and establishes arrangements in advance to enable timely,
effective and appropriate responses to such events and situations.”*

**Response:** *“The provision of emergency services and public assistance during
or immediately after a disaster in order to save lives, reduce health impacts,
ensure public safety and meet the basic subsistence needs of the people
affected.”*

In the context of disaster management, the expected ‘normal’ situation is that
there is no disaster in progress, and people are going about their normal
daily lives. Disaster managers need to plan for the occasions when the ‘normal’
situation has been replaced by a disaster and people can no longer go about
their normal daily lives. In order to prepare for such situations, disaster
managers need to have a basic understanding of questions like:
- how many people might be in the affected area?

- how might those people be impacted?

For example are they likely to be injured, stranded, deceased, or unable to
continue with their normal economic activities;  have they lost access to
food and water?

- how will roads in the affected area be impacted?

- how many dwellings in the affected will be affected? And to what degree?

For example in a flood are buildings dry, wet (but still possibly habitable)
or flooded (with occupants evacuated)?

- if people are affected, how many of them are likely to be women, children, pregnant, elderly etc.?


Knowing the likely answers to these questions can be helpful to disaster
managers. For example if you are aware of how many people live in flood prone
areas you can estimate how many temporary shelters might be needed in the
event of a disaster, how many provisions should be stockpiled in order to
provide for the daily needs of affected people and so on. Having demographic
breakdowns for the people likely to be affected, can help disaster managers
include things like special dietary requirements for lactating women in their
disaster management planning.

This planning might also take into account expected impacts on
infrastructure - for example by planning to have sufficient rescue boats
should all the local roads be flooded.
