Introducing |project_name|
==========================

In this section we will introduce the basic concepts behind |project_name| and
the |project_name| project.

About the |project_name| project
--------------------------------

The |project_name| project (http://inasafe.org) was started in order to
provide a tool for disaster managers who want to understand what the potential
impacts of a disaster will be. Initially the focus of activity was in
Indonesia - a country that is highly vulnerable to different disasters
including flood, tsunami, volcano, earthquakes, as well as other localised
disasters such as landslides, wildfire and so on. InaSAFE has since been
adopted for use in many other countries - it is not ‘Indonesia specific’.

The underlying goal of InaSAFE is to encourage and facilitate better planning
for disasters - our slogan is **"better planning saves lives”**.
