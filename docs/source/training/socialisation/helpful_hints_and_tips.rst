well as where you can go for help.

|project_name| option menu
--------------------------

The detailed description of the |project_name| Options can be found in the

**Do I need to pay to use** |project_name| ?
No, the software is completely Free and Open Source.

the full text of which is available at www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt.

**I found a bug, how should I report it?**
We manage the project issues using a GitHub issue tracker. The |project_name|
issue tracker is open to everyone, though you will first need to register a
(free) account on GitHub to use it. You can find the GitHub self-registration
page https://github.com/signup/free.
Otherwise email inasafe-users@googlegroups.com

**Could we request a new feature?**
If you have a feature request, please use the issue tracker to let us know
about it, using the same procedure as for bug reporting.
Otherwise email inasafe-users@googlegroups.com

**Where do I get Hazard and Exposure data from?**
As explained in |project_name| functionality chapter (page 13),
you are able to get open exposure data from  www.asiapop.org for population
and  from OpenStreetMap for structures (however you may need to still
digitise the structures go to www.learnosm.org for more details). To download
OSM data see Appendix :guilabel:`Getting OpenStreetMap Data` (page 56).
For hazard information it is best to approach your government science
agencies or local universities to model earthquake,
tsunami or floods. However if it floods regularly in your region you could
also develop a community flood-prone footprint.

**Why does the plugin not show up in my QGIS Plugin Manager?**
One common issue is that if you upgraded from QGIS 1.7.x to 1.8 you may not
get the new plugin repo added to your repo list. To fix this you can do:

#. open :guilabel:`QGIS`
#. Go :guilabel:`Plugins` -> Fetch Python Plugins
#. click :guilabel:`Repositories` tab
#. click :guilabel:`add`
#. Name: Official QGIS Repository
#. Url: http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml
#. :guilabel:`Save` it and the plugin repo list should update. If it does not,
   close and open QGIS to force an update.
#. In the :guilabel:`python plugin manager` main tab now you should find
   |project_name| available
