**Introduction**

Scenario Development for Contingency Planning using OpenStreetMap (OSM) and
QGIS/InaSAFE workshop participant is adult. They have special learning
characteristic which is different than young people. For that case, trainer need
to learn adult learning characteristic. This undertstanding needed to choose
training strategy which is appropriate and effective for the workshop
participant.  Learning or Adult Education known as: andragogy, which is the
opposite of pedagogy (young education). Andragogy comes from latin: Agro, which
is mean adult and agogos which is mean leading or guiding. So andragogy is a
knowledge to leading or guiding adult people or adult learning.  Basically,
education is a process to facilitate person to search and find knowledge that
they need for their life through learning process, so every human activity has
potential to be used for study. Andragogy stimulate adult so they care capable
to search and find knowledge that they needed for their life. Adult learning is
continuously done by life experience.

**1. Adult Learning Characteristic**

Adult education is an effort which is purposed for self-improving and it is done
by an individual without any legal enforcement, without making it as major areas
of business activity (Reeves, Fansler, and Houle in Supriyanto, 2007). According
to UNESCO (Townsend Coles 1977 in Lanundi (1982)), adult learning is a whole
process which is organized based on content, level, and method, it can be formal
or informal, and it is continously or replacing basic education in school,
academy, and univeristy and work practice, so people that considered as an adult
by the society can improve their skill, enrich their knowledges, improving their
technical qualification or profesionalism, and changing their attitude and
behavior in dual perspective of their development and free and balanced
participation in social development, economy, and culture. According to Bryson
in Supriyanto (2007), adult learning is educational activity which is only using
part of time and energy to get additional intelectual.  Based on the terminology
above: (1) Adult people usually can guide by themselves, (2) Adult people has
different experience, (3) Adult people ready to learn as an effcet of their
position in development transition, (4) Adult people likely more problem-
centered learning or performance-centered learning. Below is fully
charachteristic of adult person:

a. Adult person has ability to guide themselves
b. Adult person has a lot of experience and they make their experience as
   learning source.
c. Adult person ready to learn something they needed and experience build up
   from problem solving or solving daily task.
d. Learning orientation: education is a process to improve own-abilities, skill
   and knowledge will be used for better life, learning orientation is based on
   center of activity.

Accodrding to Soedomo (1989) in Supriyadi (2007), characteristics of adult
learning are:

a.	Possibility to exchange in idea, assertion, and values
b.	Possibility for reciprocal communication
c.	Learning environment should be fun and challenging
d.	Prioritizing the role of learners
e.	Adults will learn if his opinion is respected
f.	Adult learning is unique
g.	There needs to be mutual trust between mentors and learners
h.	Adults generally have a different opinion
i.	Adults have a variety of intelligence
j.	The possibility of different ways of learning
k.	Adults learn to know the advantages and disadvantages
l.	Adult learning orientation is centered on real life
m.	Motivation from themselves

Adult learning characteristic can be specified:

a. Adult learn because there is a task demand, development demand or desire to
   improve their role. Different with young, they receive learning materials
   from teacher, adult will learn if the material can fulfill their task demand,
   development demand, or improving their role. In that case, there should be an
   explanation the connection between their task, role, and development with the
   learning materials.
b. Adult like to learn something that practicable, useful, and has benefit for
   their life. Most adult has a lot of theoretical knowledge. In that case,
   learning materials for adult should be practicable and can be useful for
   their life.
c. Adult during learning process want to be treated or appreciated as an adult.
d. Adult is rich of knowledge and insight, learning something new based on
   their experience. Adults generally have wide experience based on their
   occupation. In that case, the way to learn something new should be started
   from their experiences.
e. Adult is learning by exchange their idea with other people. Because ther are
   rich of experiences, an exchange idea is the effective way for them to learn.
f. Adult person can ask why they have to learn something before they learn
   something. If young people generally receiving learning topics, adult needs
   to know that things that they are learning are beneficial for them.
g. Adult is learning by problem-solving, not oriented based on materials. If
   things that they learned during workshop can solve their problem, then, they
   will learn better.
h. Adult is more likely learning environment that can increase their
   self-confident. This is related with their needs to be respected. Start
   learning with easy things so they can increase their self-confident.
i. Adult needs more time to learn because they need to validate new
   information. Adult not just receiving the information, but they need to
   validate the information based on their experience.
j. Adult will continuing their learning process if they satisfied with their
   learning experience.

**2. Principle of Adult Learning**

Education for adult has principle that can make it different from other
education.
This principle can make learning environment become effective and efficient.
This principle can be explain as below.

a. Partnership Principle: Partnership principle guaranteed a partnership between
   facilitator and participant.
   In that case, participant is not treated as student instead as learning
   partner so the connection that they built is not imperial based,
   but a connection that help the participant learning.
b. Real experience principle: This principle will guarantee that adult learning
   activity is happening during real life situation.
   Adult learning activity not happen in a class or simulation,
   but in real situation.
c. Togetherness Principle: This principle asserting group usability for adult
   learning activity to guarantee the maximal interaction between participant
   facilitated by facilitator.
d. Participative Principle: This principle is to push participant participative
   become maximal in adult learning, with facilitation from participant. During
   adult learning activity, each participant has to participate or take some
   part actively from the whole learning process from planning, doing, and
   evaluation.
e. Independent Principle: This principle is pushing independence of participant
   to reach learning objective. Adult learning is purposed to generate
   independent human that able to do their role as a subject or character.
   That is why, independent principle is needed.
f. Sustainable Principle: This principle is guarantee for sustainability with
   the learning material from the past to present and in the future. With this
   principle, there will be concept life long education in adult learning.
g. Benefit Principle: This principle is guarantee that whatever the adult has
   learnt, they realize the benefit. Adult person has to aware that there are
   needs that need to be fulfilled. This awareness give rise to an interest in
   learning, and a sense of responsibility as an adult then arises their
   readiness to learn.
h. Local Principle: This principle is guarantee that there will be learning
   material with specific with local. The generalization from adult learning
   result is hard to do. The result of adult learning usually comes with specific
   ability which is used by participant to solve the problem in their local area
   at the moment. This ability cannot become general like a theory, proposition,
   or principle which is can be used in anywhere, anytime. Also, this result
   cannot be applied anywhere, but it need to be applied specifically in their
   area because the result of adult learning is processed from participant’s
   experiences.
i. Integration Principle: This principle guarantee that there will be an
   integration in adult learning material. During the making of adult learning
   plan, it should be covered part of materials that can be integrated as a whole
   material, not partial of separated differently.

**3. Adult Learning Strategy**

Choosing learning strategy should be based on objective that needed to reach.
Based on objective, there are two learning strategy:

(a) learning strategy that designed to help people to arrange past experience
with the new way (re-arranging experience process), and

(b) learning strategy that designed to give new knowledge and skill
(expanding experience process):

a. Re-arranging experience process: this strategy needed for participant that
   already has knowledge and skill about the training/workshop.
   So, facilitator has a role to help participant to generalize by finding
   out experience they have and give some feedback.
   In the other hand, participant must have role to give their data about
   their experience and their opinion, analyzing experience,
   and trying to find alternative and benefit.
   This will happen if there is no threat during the process,
   and awareness from participant to find new approach for solving their
   problem is built.
b. Expanding experience process: this strategy is needed for participant that
   does not has knowledge or skill about the workshop/training.
   Facilitator has role to give new data dan new concept,
   and practicing it.
   In this case, it is necessary to have clarity for delivering the new
   content and motivating participant to know it relevance in daily life.

Based on purposes above, we understand that there are two objective for
learning, for those who already has knowledge and those who don’t. But, it need
to be remind, adult person has several characteristic that need to note to
specify its learning strategy. Based on adult characteristic, generally, adult
learning is expected to use participative learning, their participative or role
and other assignment related to learning content, time allocation, and etc. is
needed. The principle of participative learning is, facilitator not patronizing
and always giving speech, but always involve participant in activity. Strategy
are as follow:


**Practical Learning and Problem-Based Centered:**
One of the adult characteristic is they learn by solving problem and not
oriented from learning material.
If things that they learnt during the training/workshop can solve
their problem, then they will learn better.
In this case, the strategy that will be used is as follow: before the
learning activity started, facilitator should identify participant needs and
problems.
Then, it should be started with identifying authentic problem from their
daily life.
If we want to deliver new theory or information, make sure that they will be
connected with real life problem.
In this case, some method that can be use are: QA session and
discussion.
Discussion for problem solving is divided into several phases:

1) Member of a group aware of there are problems
2) Member of group individually searching for argument or opinion to solve
   their problem
3) Member of group trying to find facts or experiences to support their argument
   or opinion
4) Discussing with other member of group for solutions
5) Making a conclusion to solve the problems


Related with practicable, during adult learning, there should be field practice.
All materials should be practiced for practicable needs that will be used.
Several appropriate methods are demonstration, simulation, and practice. For
example to reach the competency using GPS for add data in OSM, it will not
useful if participant just know and understand about GPS for add data in OSM, it
need to be demonstrated by facilitator and simulated and practiced by the
participant. Some material that needs to be practiced for example how to turn on
the GPS and set up the GPS.  Adult person like to learn if the material
integrating new information with their experiences: In adult learning there are
two things, process to re-arrange and expand experiences, in this case, adult
learning should help them to reveal their experience for learning new things.
Cooperative group learning also can help them to sharing their opinion with
other participant. Next, we should help them to understand the new information.
Some of appropriate methods are QA session and discussion. For example, if you
want to teach about OSM, facilitator not just give lecture about (1) how to
visit OSM website (2) how to navigate the map (3) how to save picture from OSM
map (4) how to create OSM account (5) how to edit OSM map. Facilitator need to
find out how far or how well the participant know about those materials by
asking questions. Next facilitator can deliver additional material which is new
for participant and always connect them with their knowledge and experience.

b. **Adult people like to learn something that can improve their self-esteem**:
To improve their self-esteem, we can start from simple things with small failure
rate.  Further study increased along with their confidence. For example, when
teaching the operation of JOSM, the participants that not well-known with the
internet can start with practices such soft skills in a way to download JOSM in
pairs, participant who already well-known with the internet can teach those who
not, and then they can continue to work individually. It is intended to provide
a heavy burden in the initial training. So the next step to learn other than the
operation of JOSM. What is important here, participants should not be
embarrassed by their lack of skill for operating Internet.

c. **Adult likes learning with individual attention:** Find out their needs, try
to fulfill their needs such as break, eat, drink, etc. Ask them to make a target
plan and help them to reach their target. Do not hesitate to ask some input from
them, written or within the training session or informal. They are really like
if their individual needs get attention.

The success of adult learning strategy need to be supported with conducive
learning environment. According to Suprijanto (2007), conducive learning
environment are:

a. Encourage participant to be active and improving their talent
b. Mutual respect and appreciation environment
c. Mutual trust and open environment
d. Self-discovery environment
e. Not threatened envrionment
f. Recognize uniqueness of individual environment
g. Environment that allow difference, making mistake, and doubtful
h. Allowing participant to learn based on interest, concern, and environmental
   resources
i. Allowing participant to admit and assessing individual, group, and public
   weakness and strength
j. Allowing participant to grow based on norm and value in public


**4. Adult Learning Evaluation**

Evaluation or assessment is activity to determine how far learning process can
be implemented based on expectation. So, assessment or evaluation is focused in
activity to measure how success a program is (micro: facilitator, macro:
organization). According to Fajar, A., (2002), assessment can be determine as an
effort to get any information routine, sustainable, and comprehensive about
learning process and result, growth also attitude and behavior that reached by
participant.

Based on terminology above, evaluation process should be done
along with learning process, not just in the ned of learning process. Evaluation
is a process to describe transformation from the participant after the
training/workshop. Process means evaluation is done continuosly and
comprehensive, with methods so it will shows the expected result. It also
explained that assessment is done by collecting facts sistematically. This thing
shows that in an evaluation process, we need to collect data or measure.

Technique, method or evaluation tool is the way or process that used for
collectiong informations or data which used for assessment material. This
technique will affect the result. Basically, technique, or assessment method can
be divided into two, they are, test technique or method and non-test technique
or method. In cognitive aspect, we can use exam test, oral or written. It
expected that this aspect can improve affective aspect for participant.
Affective aspect can be done by observation and questioner, and psychomotor
aspect can be assessed through the activity and result.

Evaluation theory above basically similar between pedagogy and andragogy, but,
the way to evaluate is different. In adult learning, evaluation method should be
reflected to freedom, it means the evaluation should come from participant, not
from outside coercion. Also it explain that adult learning has to be able assesst
themzelves. Terminology for “exam” or text for adult is self-examination. Some
example for evaluation method for adult are:

a. Feedback: Every participant is given chance to give opinion and feeling about
   the new learning process.
b. Reflection: Participant is given chance to give their reflection. Reflection
   is subjective and unique, so facilitator should not give any feedback.
c. Group DiscussionL Every participant is given chance to discuss their self
   evaluation and put it on a report.
d. Questionnaire: Assessment with question form that prepared by facilitator and
   filled by participant.
e. Management team: Between participant there is a team consist of a moderator,
   secretary, and evaluator. This team has a task to create a short report and
   creating evaluation for each day of training.

The way above can help with Performance Assessment. It is a non-test assessment
that can be done with observing participant activity during the learning
process. This assessment is appropriate to assess competency that reached which
is require participant to do some task such as practice and simulation.
Performance Assessment need to consider these things:

a. Feedback: Every participant is given chance to give opinion and feeling about
   the new learning process.
b. Reflection: Participant is given chance to give their reflection. Reflection
   is subjective and unique, so facilitator should not give any feedback.
c. Group DiscussionL Every participant is given chance to discuss their self
   evaluation and put it on a report.
d. Questionnaire: Assessment with question form that prepared by facilitator and
   filled by participant.
e. Management team: Between participant there is a team consist of a moderator,
   secretary, and evaluator. This team has a task to create a short report and
   creating evaluation for each day of training.

The way above can help with Performance Assessment. It is a non-test assessment
that can be done with observing participant activity during the learning
process. This assessment is appropriate to assess competency that reached which
is require participant to do some task such as practice and simulation.

Performance Assessment need to consider these things:

• Performance measures that are expected to be undertaken by participants to
  demonstrate the performance of a competence.
• Completeness and accuracy aspects that will be assessed in the performance.
• Special abilities are required to complete the task.
• Strive skills that will be assessed are not too much, so that all can be
  observed.
• Ability to be assessed sorted by the order of the observations.

*Performance Assessment Technique*

Performance observation need to be done in every context to determine the level
of skill that reached. To observe this performance, participant can use tools or
instrument such as:

1) Check list

Performance assessment can be done by using checklist (yes-no). With performance
assessment using checklist, participant will get score if evaluator can observe
the criteria of mastering a competency. The disadvantages of using this method,
evaluator only has two choices, for example correct-wrong, observable-
unobservable. In that case, there is not middle score, therefore, checklist is
more practicable to observe large number of subjects. Example of checklist:

+=======+========================+=================+===============+
| No.   | Scoring Aspect         | Good            | Not Good      |
+=======+========================+=================+===============+
| 1.    |                        |                 |               |
+-------+------------------------+-----------------+---------------+
| 2.    |                        |                 |               |
+-------+------------------------+-----------------+---------------+
| 3.    |                        |                 |               |
+-------+------------------------+-----------------+---------------+
| Total Score                    |                                 |
+-------+------------------------+-----------------+---------------+
| Maximum Score                  |                                 |
+-------+------------------------+-----------------+---------------+


2) Rating scale

Performance Assessment whish is using scaling for scoring so it is possible for
evalutor to give middle score for each competence, because of the score is given
continuosly (there more than two scoring options). The scale is ranged from not
perfect to perfect. For example: 1 = not competent, 2 = enough competent, 3 =
competent, 4 = very competent. This is the example:

+=======+========================+========+=======+=======+=======+
| No.   | Scoring Aspect         | Score                          |
+=======+========================+========+=======+=======+=======+
|       |                        |  1     | 2     | 3     | 4     |
+-------+------------------------+--------+-------+-------+-------+
| 1.    |                        |        |       |       |       |
+-------+------------------------+--------+-------+-------+-------+
| 2.    |                        |        |       |       |       |
+-------+------------------------+--------+-------+-------+-------+
| 3.    |                        |        |       |       |       |
+-------+------------------------+--------+-------+-------+-------+
| Total Score                    |                                |
+-------+------------------------+-----------------+--------------+
| Maximum Score                  | 9                              |
+-------+------------------------+-----------------+--------------+

Note:

1 = not competent, 2 = enough competent, 3 = competent, 4 = very competent

If there is one participant getting score 16, he/she will be considered as very
competent participant. And so on depend on total score.  If at school, teacher
can fill in this performance assessment, but, for adult learning, facilitator
and participant can fill in together. And the result can be part of discussion
material or noted by management team.
