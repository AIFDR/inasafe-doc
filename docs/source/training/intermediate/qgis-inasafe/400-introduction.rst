The Australia-Indonesia Facility for Disaster Reduction (AIFDR) is a joint
initiative between the governments of Australia and Indonesia.
We work to strengthen Indonesia's ability to reduce the impact of disasters.
The Australian and Indonesian governments at a special ceremony on 15 July
2010 launched the Australia-Indonesia facility.
The launch marks an important event in the strong relationship now shared by
both countries and their united commitment to better prepare for and respond
to natural disasters in Indonesia.

Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT)
=====================================

Free, collaborative maps are uniquely valuable to humanitarian work,
especially in places where base map data is often scarce, out of date,
or rapidly changing.
OpenStreetMap is a web project to create a free and open map of the entire
world, built entirely by volunteers surveying with GPS,
digitizing aerial imagery, and collecting and liberating existing public
sources of geographic data.
The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is an initiative to apply the
principles and activities of open source and open data sharing towards
humanitarian response and economic development.

Preface
*******

Welcome to the Intermediate Unit on Spatial Analysis.
By now you should be adept in data collection techniques and have a solid
foundation in analysis with QGIS.
In this unit we will be focusing again on InaSAFE and QGIS skills that aid
in contingency planning.

First, we will undertake a review of unit 2, to ensure that we remember all
the QGIS skills that we studied.
Then we will begin working on another InaSAFE project using flood data as
our hazard.
We will consider the best possible evacuation routes and locations for IDP
camps, calculate damages and losses and learn how to display them on a map.

This unit covers much of what we have been working toward.
We will bring together the data which we now know how to collect in
OpenStreetMap, QGIS spatial analysis skills, and the power of InaSAFE to help
develop effective and informative contingency plans.
