BNPB is Indonesia’s National Disaster Management Agency. BNPB is a non-departmental ministerial-level government agency, tasked with providing guidance and direction to the efforts of disaster management that includes disaster prevention, emergency response, rehabilitation, and reconstruction in a fair and equal. National Disaster Management Agency has the function as a policy maker and formulator and Refugee (IDP) management to act quickly and appropriately and effectively and efficiently; and coordinating the implementation of disaster management activities in a planned, integrated, and comprehensive.

The Australia-Indonesia Facility for Disaster Reduction (AIFDR) is a joint initiative between the governments of Australia and Indonesia. We work to strengthen Indonesia's ability to reduce the impact of disasters. The Australian and Indonesian governments at a special ceremony on 15 July 2010 launched the Australia-Indonesia facility. The launch marks an important event in the strong relationship now shared by both countries and their united commitment to better prepare for and respond to natural disasters in Indonesia.

Free, collaborative maps are uniquely valuable to humanitarian work, especially in places where base map data is often scarce, out of date, or rapidly changing. OpenStreetMap is a web project to create a free and open map of the entire world, built entirely by volunteers surveying with GPS, digitizing aerial imagery, and collecting and liberating existing public sources of geographic data. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is an initiative to apply the principles and activities of open source and open data sharing towards humanitarian response and economic development.

Preface
*******

Welcome to the Intermediate Unit on Spatial Analysis.  By now you should be adept in data collection techniques and have a solid foundation in analysis with QGIS.  In this unit we will be focusing again on InaSAFE and QGIS skills that aid in contingency planning.

First, we will undertake a review of unit 2, to ensure that we remember all the QGIS skills that we studied.  Then we will begin working on another InaSAFE project using flood data as our hazard.  We will consider the best possible evacuation routes and locations for IDP camps, calculate damages and losses and learn how to display them on a map.

This unit covers much of what we have been working toward.  We will bring together the data which we now know how to collect in OpenStreetMap, QGIS spatial analysis skills, and the power of InaSAFE to help develop effective and informative contingency plans.
