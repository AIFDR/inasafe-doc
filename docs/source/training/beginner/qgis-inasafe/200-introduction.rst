Preface
*******
A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a system designed to
enable people to work with data related to places on the Earth.  A GIS allows
the creation, storage, manipulation, and analysis of geographic data.  GIS is a
very broad concept and can involve complex hardware and software.  But for most
people’s purposes, a simple GIS software application is all that is required

GIS in general can be used for a variety of fields, including in disaster
management. Unfortunately, the GIS software currently on the market are very
expensive. Therefore we make a guide how to analyze the data with GIS software,
which is free and open for the purposes of disaster management, particularly in
the preparation of contingency plans.

The software used is Quantum GIS (QGIS) is a Geographic Information System (GIS)
that is user-friendly and open-source. InaSAFE  is a free software and open-
source, that can create realistic scenario of natural disasters impact for
planning, preparation, and better response. InaSAFE is developed by AIFDR
through consultation with BNPB.

Analyzing Data with QGIS and InaSAFE is designed to complement the
previous unit to collect spatial data with OpenStreetMap for scenario
development for contingency plan.

We hope it can be useful.

The Australia-Indonesia Facility for Disaster Reduction (AIFDR) is a joint
initiative between the governments of Australia and Indonesia. We work to
strengthen Indonesia's ability to reduce the impact of disasters. The Australian
and Indonesian governments at a special ceremony on 15 July 2010 launched the
Australia-Indonesia facility. The launch marks an important event in the strong
relationship now shared by both countries and their united commitment to better
prepare for and respond to natural disasters in Indonesia.

Free, collaborative maps are uniquely valuable to humanitarian work, especially
in places where base map data is often scarce, out of date, or rapidly changing.
OpenStreetMap is a web project to create a free and open map of the entire
world, built entirely by volunteers surveying with GPS, digitizing aerial
imagery, and collecting and liberating existing public sources of geographic
data. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is an initiative to apply the
principles and activities of open source and open data sharing towards
humanitarian response and economic development.
