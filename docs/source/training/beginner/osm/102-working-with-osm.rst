Module 2: Working with OSM
==========================

**Learning Objectives**

- Visit OpenStreetMap website
- Navigate map in OpenStreetMap website
- Saving image from OpenStreetMap
- Register an OpenStreetMap account
- Editing a map
- Save Edits


In this module we will learn step by step how to navigate the OpenStreetMap
website, view and print maps, and sign up for a user account.  After you
have your own username and password, you will be able to add your first
points to the map.

**1. Visit the OpenStreetMap Website**

- Be sure that your computer is on and you are connected to the internet.
- To visit the OpenStreetMap website, you need to open your web browser.
  Start your browser - Firefox, Chrome, Opera, or Internet Explorer.
- In the address bar at the top of the window, enter the following text:
  `www.openstreetmap.org <http://www.openstreetmap.org>`_
- When the page has finished loading, you should see something like this:

.. image:: /static/training/beginner/osm/image12.*
   :align: center

**2. Navigate the Map**

- The main thing you should see is the map.  Move the map by clicking on it
  with your left mouse button, holding the button down,
  and dragging your mouse around.
- If you have a mouse with a scroll-wheel, zoom in and out on the map by
  turning the wheel.  If you don’t have a scroll-wheel,
  use the :guilabel:`+` and :guilabel:`-`  buttons on in the upper right corner
  of the map.
- To search for a place, :guilabel:`Left Click` in the box labelled 
  :guilabel:`Search` on the left side of the page. Type in the name of your 
  town or village and press :guilabel:`Enter`.  A window should appear to the 
  left of the map with the results of your search.  Click on the location that 
  looks like the one you want.  The map will automatically move to the location
  you chose.


**3. Save an Image of the OSM Map**

- If you want to save an image from OpenStreetMap that you can easily print,
  follow these instructions.
- Just above the map, click on the button labelled :guilabel:`Share` on the 
  right side of the map.

- Then will appears option like this:

.. image:: /static/training/beginner/osm/image14.*
   :align: center

- In the Image section, check :guilabel:`Set custom dimensions` if you want 
  to manually specify which area you want to download. If you do not select 
  the option, then the area that will be downloaded to adjust the map you're 
  currently on.
- You can download the image in PNG, JPEG, SVG or PDF format according to your 
  needs.
- You can also determine the scale of the map that will be downloaded by 
  entering the scale rate.
- Then click :guilabel:`Download`. The download process will start. It will be 
  stored in your computer.
- Open the file that you have downloaded. If you want to print, you can select 
  :guilabel:`Print` from the :menuselection:`File` menu, after you connect your computer to a printer.

**4. Create an OpenStreetMap Account**

- Now that you have seen what the main website looks like, you can register 
  for a username and password and make your first additions to the map.
- Go back to the OpenStreetMap website.  Click :guilabel:`sign up` in the 
  top right corner of the page.
- You should see a new page that looks like this:

.. image:: /static/training/beginner/osm/image15.*
   :align: center

- There are five boxes on this page that you need to fill in to register an
  account with OSM.
- Enter your email address in the first two boxes.  You should enter the same
  email address in both boxes.  Later, you will need to open your email to
  confirm your account with OpenStreetMap.
- In the third box, enter the username that you would like to have.  You
  will not be able to choose a username that someone else has chosen before,
  so it should be creative.  If you try to enter something simple,
  like your first name, it is likely that someone has already claimed that
  name.
- Enter a new password in the fourth and fifth boxes.  You should enter the
  same password in both boxes.  It does not need to be the same as the
  password for your email.
- You will want to remember your user name and your password so that you can
  login later.  You may want to write down your OSM username and password.
- After you have completed all the boxes, click :guilabel:`Continue` at the 
  bottom of the page.
- If there are any problems, an error message may pop up.  Check to make
  sure that your email is the same in the first to boxes,
  and your password is the same in the bottom two boxes.  If the third box is
  highlighted red, it means that someone else has already chosen your
  username, and you should try a different name.
- Open a separate window or tab in your internet browser,
  and navigate to your email.  Common email sites are
  `mail.yahoo.com <http://mail.yahoo.com>`_ and
  `gmail.com <http://gmail.com>`_

- Enter your email address and your email password to open your email.  Note
  that this is not the same as your OpenStreetMap username and password.
- If everything was successful with your registration,
  you should see an email from OpenStreetMap in your inbox.  Open the email.
  It should look like the image below.  Click on the link that is identified
  below:

 .. image:: /static/training/beginner/osm/image16.*
    :align: center

- A new tab or window will open.  If everything went well,
  you should have an OSM account!
- On the OpenStreetMap page, click “log in” in the top right corner.  Enter
  your OpenStreetMap username and password and press Enter.  You should now be
  logged in.  You should see your username in the upper right corner of the
  page.

**5. Adding Your First Points**

- Now that you are logged in with your username on the OpenStreetMap website,
  you can use the Potlatch editor to add your first point to the map.
- Move the map to a place that you know very well, such as your town or village.
- Zoom in to a place where you would like to add a point to the map.
- Just above the map on the left, there is a tab marked :guilabel:`Edit`. Hover 
  your mouse over this button, but don’t click.  You should see a menu drop 
  down.
- Click :guilabel:`Edit with Potlatch 2 (in-browser editor)`
- The online editor for OpenStreetMap should open.  If a window pops up, press 
  :guilabel:`OK`
- You can add a point to the map by clicking on an icon on the left, and 
  dragging it to its location on the map.  After you add the point and are 
  satisfied that it is correct, click :guilabel:`Save` in the upper right 
  corner.

.. Note::  If you are not sure about the accuracy of the point(s) you add, 
           don’t click :guilabel:`Save` ! Play around with the Potlatch editor, 
           but don’t save your changes.
