Module 2: Working with OSM
==========================

**Learning Objectives**

- Visit OpenStreetMap website
- Navigate map on OSM website
- Save an image from OSM 
- Register an OSM account
- Edit the OSM map       
- Save edits             

In this module we will learn step by step how to navigate the OpenStreetMap
website, view and print maps, and sign up for a user account.  After you
have your own username and password, you will be able to add your first
points to the map.

1. Visit the OpenStreetMap Website
----------------------------------

- Be sure that your computer is on and you are connected to the internet.
- To visit the OpenStreetMap website, you need to open your web browser.
  Start your browser - Firefox, Chrome, Opera, or Internet Explorer.
- In the address bar at the top of the window, enter the following text:
  `www.openstreetmap.org <http://www.openstreetmap.org>`_
- When the page has finished loading, you should see something like this:

.. image:: /static/training/beginner/osm/image12.*
   :align: center

2. Navigate the Map
-------------------

- The main thing you should see is the map.  Move the map by clicking on it
  with your left mouse button, holding the button down,
  and dragging your mouse around.
- If you have a mouse with a scroll-wheel, zoom in and out on the map by
  turning the wheel.  If you don’t have a scroll-wheel,
  use the :guilabel:`+` and :guilabel:`-` buttons on in the upper right corner
  of the map.
- To search for a place, left-click in the box labeled
  :guilabel:`Search` on the left side of the page. Type in the name of your
  town or village and press Enter.  A window should appear to the
  left of the map with the results of your search.  Click on the location that
  looks like the one you want.  The map will automatically move to the location
  you chose.

3. Save an Image of the OSM Map
-------------------------------

- If you want to save an image from OpenStreetMap that you can easily print,
  follow these instructions.
- Just above the map, click on the button labeled :guilabel:`Share` on the
  right side of the map.

- Options will appear which look like this:

.. image:: /static/training/beginner/osm/image14.*
   :align: center

- In the Image section, check :guilabel:`Set custom dimensions` if you want
  to manually specify which area you want to download. If you do not select
  the option, then the downloaded area will adjust to the current extent
  of the map.
- You may download the image in PNG, JPEG, SVG or PDF format according to your
  needs.
- You can also determine the scale of the map that will be downloaded by
  entering the scale rate.
- Then click :guilabel:`Download`. The download process will start. It will be
  stored in your computer.
- Open the file that you have downloaded. If you want to print, select
  :guilabel:`Print` from the :menuselection:`File` menu, after you connect your computer to a printer.

4. Create an OpenStreetMap Account
----------------------------------

- Now that you have seen what the main website looks like, you can register
  for a username and password and make your first additions to the map.
- Go back to the OpenStreetMap website.  Click :guilabel:`Sign Up` in the
  top right corner of the page.
- You should see a new page that looks like this:

.. image:: /static/training/beginner/osm/image15.*
   :align: center

- There are five boxes on this page that you need to fill in to register an
  account with OSM.
- Enter your email address in the first two boxes.  You should enter the same
  email address in both boxes.  Later, you will need to open your email to
  confirm your account with OpenStreetMap.
- In the third box, enter the username that you would like to have.  You
  will not be able to choose a username that someone else has chosen before,
  so it should be creative.  If you try to enter something simple,
  like your first name, it is likely that someone has already claimed that
  name.
- Enter a new password in the fourth and fifth boxes.  You should enter the
  same password in both boxes.  It does not need to be the same as the
  password for your email.
- You will want to remember your user name and your password so that you can
  login later.  You may want to write down your OSM username and password.
- After you have completed all the boxes, click :guilabel:`Continue` at the
  bottom of the page.
- If there are any problems, an error message may pop up.  Check to make
  sure that your email is the same in the first to boxes,
  and your password is the same in the bottom two boxes.  If the third box is
  highlighted red, it means that someone else has already chosen your
  username, and you should try a different name.
- Open a separate window or tab in your internet browser,
  and navigate to your email.  Common email sites are
  `mail.yahoo.com <http://mail.yahoo.com>`_ and
  `gmail.com <http://gmail.com>`_.

- Enter your email address and your email password to open your email.  Note
  that this is not the same as your OpenStreetMap username and password.
- If everything was successful with your registration,
  you should see an email from OpenStreetMap in your inbox.  Open the email.
  It should look like the image below.  Click on the link that is identified
  below:

 .. image:: /static/training/beginner/osm/image16.*
    :align: center

- A new tab or window will open.  If everything went well,
  you should have an OSM account!
- On the OpenStreetMap page, click “Log In” in the top right corner.  Enter
  your OpenStreetMap username and password and press Enter.  You should now be
  logged in.  You should see your username in the upper right corner of the
  page.

5. Adding Your First Points
---------------------------

- Now that you are logged in with your username on the OpenStreetMap website,
  you can add your first point to the map.
- Move the map to a place that you know very well, such as your town or village.
- Zoom in to a place where you would like to add a point to the map.
- Just above the map on the left, there is a tab marked :guilabel:`Edit`. Click
  on the arrow next to it to open a drop-down menu.
- Click :guilabel:`Edit with iD (in-browser editor)`
- The online editor for OpenStreetMap should open. For a tour of the editor, click
  :guilabel:`Start the Walkthrough`. To begin editing, click :guilabel:`Edit Now`.
- Add a point to the map by clicking :guilabel:`Point` at the top, and then clicking
  a location on the map. Select the type of location from the menu on the left
  and add any other information that you know. If you are
  satisfied that the information is correct, click :guilabel:`Save` at the top.

.. Note::  If you are not sure about the accuracy of the point(s) you add,
           don’t click :guilabel:`Save`! Play around with the iD editor,
           but don’t save your changes.
