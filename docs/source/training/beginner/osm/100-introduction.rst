Preface
*******
Every day thousands of people contribute to OpenStreetMap, a project with the lofty goal of mapping the world. Most OSM software is free and open source, and the data is open for anyone to use. The idea is simple: if you make a map of your town and I make a map of mine, we can share those maps on a common platform. With enough people contributing, we can make maps and collect data throughout the world.

Collecting Spatial Data using OSM Beginner Level is a step by step guide designed to help anyone get started with OSM, no matter what skill level you are starting from. While it might seem daunting at first, OSM is simple enough that anyone can get started creating maps, and as your understanding grows you'll find that you can do more and more interesting things.

This guide makes few assumptions. It assumes you have used a computer before, and that you have an email address. If you don't have an email address, we suggest you have a friend help you sign up for one. There are many websites where you can get a free email address, such as www.gmail.com or mail.yahoo.com.

The only other assumption is that you've used the internet before. Perhaps you're familiar with Facebook or email, and that's certainly enough to get started with OpenStreetMap. If you're already comfortable using a computer and surfing the web, don't worry – this guide is for you too. No matter your proficiency, we'll take you step by step through OSM and you'll be mapping in no time!

We hope it can be useful.

The Australia-Indonesia Facility for Disaster Reduction (AIFDR) is a joint initiative between the governments of Australia and Indonesia. We work to strengthen Indonesia's ability to reduce the impact of disasters. The Australian and Indonesian governments at a special ceremony on 15 July 2010 launched the Australia-Indonesia facility. The launch marks an important event in the strong relationship now shared by both countries and their united commitment to better prepare for and respond to natural disasters in Indonesia.

Free, collaborative maps are uniquely valuable to humanitarian work, especially in places where base map data is often scarce, out of date, or rapidly changing. OpenStreetMap is a web project to create a free and open map of the entire world, built entirely by volunteers surveying with GPS, digitizing aerial imagery, and collecting and liberating existing public sources of geographic data. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is an initiative to apply the principles and activities of open source and open data sharing towards humanitarian response and economic development.
