About Toolkit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Beginner QGIS-InaSAFE Toolkit** is designed to prepare facilitators to
deliver training for QGIS and InaSAFE new user. The materials contained in
it will prepare you to carry out training with a variety of audiences,
including common problems and mistakes, as well as providing a variety of
best methodologies for you to be able inviting new mappers.

When planning a QGIS-InaSAFE training, there are some factors that need to
be considered, including time, available resources, number of facilitators
with their technical skills. This toolkit will help you to prepare a
training for every type of audiences, but it will more focused on teaching
for those who has limited capacity or experience using GIS software,
making maps, and computer.

The purpose of this toolkit is preparing you, as facilitators,
to train participant in a workshop successfully in order to processing
digital map with QGIS and analyzing hazard and exposure data with InaSAFE.

Common Problem
**************

**How if the plugin is failed during installation?**

This can be caused by internet connection, internet connection is needed
during plugin installation especially if the plugin file is big like InaSAFE
. The trouble can be tackle by preparing the plugin file in a flash drive.
Then copy the plugin to C:\Users\Computer\.qgis\python\plugins folder.

**How if Fetch Python Plugin - Plugin menu is not available?**

This problem can be solved by opening settings from *fetch python plugin*
option menu. You have to tick *check for updates* on startup which should
add list of new plugin automatically.

|    attributes in the vector data and then let participants        |               |               |
|    explore the contents of data attribute vector points,          |               |               |
|    lines, and polygon for approximately 5-10 minutes.             |               |               |
| 4. Then, explain how the vector data work in QGIS,                |               |               |
|    then teach how to change the symbols into symbols              |               |               |
|    or shapes we want.                                             |               |               |

|    corresponding magnification level is very                      |               |               |
|    important, explain that it is important because we             |               |               |
|    do not want to see our map symbols are messy                   |               |               |
|    because too many objects that appear especially if             |               |               |
|    we have a map with small scale.                                |               |               |

| Allow about 30 minutes for the participants so that               |               |               |
| they can practice independently in setting symbology              |               |               |
| of vector data. Give a motivation to them so they can             |               |               |
| set symbology better than before. After that, do the              |               |               |
| valuation by asking the participants to evaluate his              |               |               |
| partner work.                                                     |               |               |

FAQ (Frequently Asked Question)
*******************************

**When adding vector data, why my vector data do not show up in the folder?**

Sometimes participants are still difficult to distinguish between button to
open the vector data and raster data (because both are adjacent). Make sure
again whether participants have clicked the correct button.

**When adding vector data, why there are some data that does not appear on the QGIS display?**

Check back order of the data layer, the polygon should be at the bottom,
followed by the line, then the point at the top.

**When identifying vector data attribute with identifier, why the attribute window does not appear after on-click?**

Check back, before clicking on a point, line, or polygon,
make sure vector data layer is selected in the list before.

FAQ (Frequently Asked Question)
*******************************

**How to get raster data?**

Raster data can be obtained depending to needs. If you need raster data such
as SRTM can be downloaded at http://dwtkns.com/srtm/ and for raster data
associated with the data for earthquakes can be obtained from
http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/shakemap/list.php. Can also be
obtained from the relevant agencies to the needs of the raster data.

**How to use raster data as needed?**

This is related to resolution. If you want to use raster data for mapping
building or digitizing like Bing, it will be better to use raster data that
has a resolution of 0.5 to 1 meter. If you want land use can be mapped using
Landsat imagery.

FAQ (Frequently Asked Question)
*******************************

**Why is my buffer result looks bigger than the one shown in the example?**

This happens because of the projection. The projection used for the data
that are going to be buffered is not in Projection (Universal Transverse
Mercator) system so the buffer input (in meter) could not be applied to the
data that are going to be analyzed and resulting to the buffer that looked
big.

**Why is the query builder result doesnt show up?**

This is because missed input into the query builder. Watch carefully what you
are inputting into the query builder.

|                                                                   |               | *presentation*|
| 1. In this session you will be explaining how to make             | Practice      |               |
|    maps that are ready to be printed using                        |               | Projector     |
|    QGIS. First, you need to explain that it is                    |               |               |
|    important to change the projection system into                 |               | Module 11     |
|    mercator projection system (Universal Transverse               |               |               |
|    Mercator/UTM) and ask the participant to change                |               |               |
|    all of the data projection into the same projection system.    |               |               |
| 2. Ask the basic elements that must be put into the               |               |               |
|    map to the participants and show them some                     |               |               |
|    examples of good maps and bad maps. You should                 |               |               |
|    emphasize the basic elements of maps to the participants.      |               |               |
| 3. After that you should explain the interface of the             |               |               |
|    Map Composer in QGIS. Explain about the                        |               |               |
|    functions of the toolbars and then do practice and             |               |               |
|    input the data into the print composer page, adjust            |               |               |
|    the scale so all of the data that needed to be shown           |               |               |
|    can be seen. The next part is adding map title.                |               |               |
| 4. The next step is adding the north sign and scale               |               |               |
|    into the map. Give the participant understanding               |               |               |
|    that there are 2 types of scale, numerical and                 |               |               |
|    graphical. The numeric scale is using number to                |               |               |
|    compare real distance and graphic scale. The                   |               |               |
|    graphical scale is using scale bar as the distance comparison. |               |               |
| 5. The next element that needs to be added to the map             |               |               |
|    is legend, inset, and grid. Explains why those                 |               |               |
|    elements are important. The legend needs to be                 |               |               |
|    shown because it help the map user to understand               |               |               |
|    the symbols contained in the map. Inset needs to be            |               |               |
|    shown to show the location of the map from the                 |               |               |
|    smaller scale (for example 1:500.000 or                        |               |               |
|    1:5000.000). Grid will make it easier for us to                |               |               |
|    determine the location through the coordinates.                |               |               |
| 6. After finishing the map, tell the participant to save          |               |               |
|    the print composer and tell the participant about the          |               |               |
|    final format that they can use in the print composer,          |               |               |
|    such as .pdf, .jpeg, and .svg, using the export feature.       |               |               |

FAQ (Frequently Asked Question)
*******************************

**In the x and y intervals in the grid, I put the right number as explained, but why does the grid not showing up?**

This is because the projection system is still using geographic projection
system WGS 82) that is in decimal degree. To make the x and y intervals,
it is better to use the mercator projection system so the intervals will be
in meter.

FAQ (Frequently Asked Question)
*******************************

Sometimes the results from InaSAFE analysis are different from one to another
. This is because of the zoom level, so InaSAFE only processing the area seen
on the window/map.
