About Toolkit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Toolkit  QGIS-InaSAFE For Intermediate** design as a guide for facilitator
to train users of QGIS and |project_name| who followed the beginner training
before.
The materials in this guide will preparing you to do training with the wide
range participants, including common problem and also provide the best
methodology for you to train the participants to increase their skill in data
processing and data analysis with QGIS and |project_name|.

When you plan for QGIS-|project_name| training for Intermediate,
there are some factors that you have to be considered,
like duration of training, resources, numbers of facilitator,
and their technical skill.
Do not forget before follow this training the participants have been followed
the beginner training of OSM and QGIS-|project_name| before.
This Toolkit will help you to prepare training for wide range
participants, however it would be focus to how to teach them to increase
their knowledge and skill.

The purpose of this toolkit is for preparing you, facilitators,
to teach participants to process digital map on QGIS and a hazard data
analysis and exposure with |project_name| correctly.

Purpose of Workshop
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This workshop is purposed to achieve competency standard and basic competency
as follows.

*Standard Competency*
*********************
Spatial data analysis using QGIS and |project_name| which is related to
contingency planning.

*Basic Competency*
******************
1. Understand QGIS concept
2. Preparing data and keywords for|project_name|
3. Choosing a temporary IDP camps or evacuation
4. Planning evacuation route based on hazard information.
5. Calculate damage and losses

Workshop Materials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. QGIS Review
2. Preparing data and keywords for |project_name|
3. Planning temporary shelter
4. Planning evacuation route
5. Calculate damage and losses

Workshop Strategies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Methods applied in this workshop is participatory teaching,
   emphasizes on full participation of the participant in every section and
   activities during the workshop, instead of lecture method.
2. Participants oriented.
   Participants are encouraged to find and getting knowledge and skill needed
   by themselves.
3. Trainers serve as facilitators.
   Trainers only facilitate in order to the ideas emerged during the workshop
   come from the participants, not only from trainers.
   However, trainers must be ready and give the better knowledge and argument
   when the participants need any assistance.
4. *Outcome* oriented. Workshop must produces *outcomes* mentioned before.

Tools
^^^^^
1. Copy of  “Guide of Data Analysis using QGIS/|project_name| Intermediate” for
   participants.
2. A indoor room with tables and chairs.
3. Some computer units.
   (At least one computer for two participants, better if one computer for
   one participants)
4. Two Projectors (For presentation and demonstrate all technical software)
5. Flashdisk to copy files and software
6. Good internet connection
7. Snacks and Coffee Break

Schedule
^^^^^^^^
These are outline for training schedule for five days that has been tested
to a wide range participants in some provinces in Indonesia.
You can changes or give advice about this schedule related our discussion
before.

**Common Problem**

The use of this road graph plugin should turn off "On the Fly" in the projection
system because if it is not turned off, the analysis of road graph plugin will
not appear despite being defined starting point and end point.
