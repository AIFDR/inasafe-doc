About Toolkit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**The Beginning OpenStreetMap Trainer Toolkit** is designed to prepare
trainers to deliver an introductory training course to new users of OSM.
The materials included will prepare trainers to conduct trainings with a
variety of audiences and to cover common problems and pitfalls,
and also provide trainers with the best methodologies to engage new mappers.

When organizing an OpenStreetMap workshop, numerous factors must be
considered, including the length of time you have to train,
available resources, number of trainee and their technical skills.
This toolkit will help trainers prepare trainings for different types of
participants, but it will primarily focus on educating those with little or
no experience with GPS, map making, and computers.

The purpose of this toolkit is to prepare the trainer, to successfully train
workshop participants in adding spatial data to OpenStreetMap.

Purpose of Workshop
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This workshop is purposed to achieve competency standard and basic competency
as follows.

*Standard Competency*
*********************
Collecting Spatial Data with OSM

*Basic Competency*
******************
1. Drawing map of an area as basic understanding of *OpenStreetMap*
2. Be able to operate *OpenStreetMap*
3. Be able to operate *JOSM*
4. Be able to use *GPS* to add data to *OSM*
5. Be able to use *Field Papers* to add data to *OSM*
6. Be able to edit a map and add information to *OSM* using *JOSM*
7. Correct *imagery offset*
8. Getting *OSM* data in a specific format to be analyzed further in GIS
   (Geographic Information System) software

Workshop Materials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Basic concept of *OpenStreetMap* website
2. Working with *OSM*
3. Working with *JOSM*
4. Using *GPS*
5. *Field Papers*
6. Editing *OpenStreetMap* through *JOSM*
7. *Imagery Offset*
8. Getting *OSM* Data

Workshop Strategies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Methods applied in this workshop are participatory teaching,
   emphasizes on full participation of the participant in every section and
   activities during the workshop, instead of lecture method.
2. Participants oriented.
   Participants are encouraged to find and getting knowledge and skill needed
   by themselves.
3. Trainers serve as facilitators.
   Trainers only facilitate in order to the ideas emerged during the workshop
   come from the participants, not only from trainers.
   However, trainers must be ready and give the better knowledge and argument
   when the participants need any assistance.
4. *Outcome* oriented. Workshop must produces *outcomes* mentioned before.

^^^^^
1. Copy of 'Data Collection Using OSM for Beginner Guide' for participants.
2. A place or room, with tables and seats.
3. Computer (ideally, one computer is used by two participants,
   but it will be better if one computer is used by one participant).
4. A Printer (to print out *Field Papers*).
5. A Projector (to present slide and demonstrate technical instruction and
   software).
6. *GPS* devices (ideally, one *GPS* is used by two or three participants in
   a group).
7. Battery for *GPS* devices.
8. USB cable to connect *GPS* devices to computer.
9. USB *Flashdisk* to transfer *file* and *software*.
10. Good internet connection.

FAQ (Frequently Asked Question)
*******************************

**How did the UK begin mapping? How did OpenStreetMap start?**

*OpenStreetMap* started with just a handful of volunteers who had GPS devices.
They went out, collected data on their GPS and made sketches of maps and
take notes, and then add the data into OSM database at home.
These initial volunteers hosted "Mapping Parties" in different towns,
in which anybody could come out with them one day and go mapping.
These parties helped expanding the network of volunteers,
get more people involved, and create great maps of different towns.

**How did they create maps so thoroughly? What technologies did they use?**

At the beginning, mappers only had GPS to work with, and any map data that
was freely given to the *OpenStreetMap* community.
Later, *OSM* made a deal with *Yahoo!* to be able to use their satellite
imagery to digitize maps with.
More recently, Microsoft has made its imagery available to *OSM*.

**Can we use OSM with Google Maps?**

It is not legal to use *Google Maps* as a resource when editing
*OpenStreetMap*.
Google has not given permission for this like Microsoft has,
and so it is not acceptable to use.

|   license which all of the data in *OpenStreetMap* can be used    |               | Module 2      |

|   attribution and contribute back to *OpenStreetMap*              |               |               |
| - If users choose public domain when they were *sign up*, it      |               |               |
|   means that they are do not care what OSM license is, and        |               |               |

FAQ (Frequently Asked Question)
*******************************

**Forgot Password**

Sometimes participants forget their password.
In this case,you need to help them to reset or make a new password,
if that is not possible you have to make a new email account.
If the participants already have an *OpenStreetMap* account but they forget the
password, you could help them to reset their password and sent it to their
email.

**Do not have email**

If participants do not have an email account, you need to help them make a new
one.

**Software is missing (Flash)**

If you decided to show participants how to edit using *Potlach editor* in the
*OSM* website, they will need to install Flash on their computer first.
The guide to install flash is in the **Beginners Guide**.
Please remember this activity would takes some hours for this session.

|        as a label which put in the objects and every label        |               |               |

|        different attribute, but the easiest way to add it to the  |               |               |
|        objects is using presets menu.                             |               |               |
|      - Add your own preset to the menu.                           |               |               |

Common Problem
**************

**Setting on Mac and Ubuntu**

The steps to install on Mac and Ubuntu are quite easy.
JOSM is a software based on Java so it is platform independent,
but you have to make sure Java is already installed on your computer
system.
GPSBabel does not have a GUI for Linux, so it would be hard for Linux users
especially for newbie users.
This software is not included in the system packet for Windows but it is easy to
be downloaded for Mac or Linux.

**JOSM runs out of memory**

Sometimes if someone downloads a lot of imagery and data on JOSM,
the computer runs out of memory and crashes.
The solution is to start JOSM with a batch file that will tell JOSM to add extra
memory.
An example batch file is provide in this toolkit, but you have to edit it
using a text editor to put the file-josm.jar in the right way.

**Participants add tag on nodes not in the ways**

Sometimes it is difficult to new OSM users to understand that a way consists of
several nodes.
Therefore any tag is supposed to be put on the way or polygon rather
than nodes on the ways.
As an example, new users select all nodes on the objects by drawing a box around
the object.
This will make all of the nodes having tags whereas the nodes should not have the tags
but rather the "object"(line,polygon) should have.
This is important for you to know from beginning, for a good mapping.

FAQ (Frequently Asked Question)
*******************************

**Is there any easy way to restart JOSM after we finished installing plugins?**

Yes, there is a plugin that you can add which allow you to restart JOSM by
clicking a button.
To activate it, install it in preferences.

**Could we make a tag in Bahasa Indonesia?**

Theoretical, you can add any tag to nodes, ways or shapes on OSM.
But because all of the objects on OSM are saved in international databases
and cover the whole world, we need a consensus about how to make a tag.
As an example, a hospital is still a hospital in England, France and
even in Indonesia.
If every country gives a tag with their own language it will be difficult and
confusing to show the icon or symbol for different locations.
Because OSM is made in England, and english is a very common language
all over the world, the english language is the language which is accepted for
tagging in OpenStreetMap.
However if you want to make the preset menu using your own language it is
still possible.

**Can we change the color of nodes and ways and can we change the icon and symbol? How can we print it?**

You can change the color of the objects in setting menu.
This is very useful especially when it is hard to see nodes on ways and
shapes on different background.
When participants ask about how to change the symbol or show the name of
objects, you need to tell them that this program is for editing data and
not to see the preview or result and print a map.
All of the nodes and tags will be saved in a database, but you can use some other
software to make your map better.
A good example is OpenStreetMap, but there are a lot more available.
The difference between editing data and rendering on another software might
be quite hard to understand by participants in the beginning.

**What the difference between preset and tag?**

A tag is a part of an information that you can put in nodes,
ways or shapes (polygon) to describe one of the attributes.
Preset is a simple way to give a tag to the objects without knowing how to fix
the tag manually.
As an example you have to give a tag to the hospital (tag amenity=hospital)
to identify it correctly, but because there are lots of tags it is easier
using the preset menu that will make the correct tag automatically.

Common Problem
**************

**Make sure you have battery and reserve cable**

It is not a good thing if your GPS runs of your battery,
so make sure every group has reserve batteries when they go out to mapping.
When they come back, they need to move the data from GPS to the computer.
It is better if every group has its own cable, in that way it will be a lot
faster copying the data to the computer.

**Same format to all GPS**

Before training, make sure all GPS devices are set to the same format.
This is for not confusing the participants.
The main point that we have to make sure is:

- Arrangement from page is same: Main Menu. Track Menu, Map, Satellites.
- Save coordinate in decimal degrees.
- Units are in meter.
- Elevation has been calibrated.

FAQ (Frequently Asked Question)
*******************************

**What projection does that GPS use to collect the Data?**

GPS can be set to record in different projections, but for our need,
the GPS must be set on coordinate geographic projection WGS84 (EPSG:4326).

**How accurate is the GPS? How can the accuracy affect the data?**

Your GPS usually has an accuracy of about 3-15 meter.
Satellites pages on your GPS indicate the accuracy when it is in use.
For our mapping needs, inaccuracy like that can be ignored.

FAQ (Frequently Asked Question)
*******************************

**How can we print big size maps?**
**An example for a poster or community mapping project?**

One of the best ways to do this is using the QGIS program,
but this is not a topic covered in this session.
You can make some clue about QGIS after you practice and understand how to
produce a big size map.
If you need to do it now, you can use http://fieldpapers.org.

**How to scan Field Papers?**

You can use a scanner or a mobile(smartphone) or a camera to take photos of
field papers and then put it into JOSM.

**What should I do if uploading the process Field Papers is really slow or does not work at all?**

Unfortunately, the Field Papers website is not always 100% working.
The process of uploading a Paper could be longer than your lunch break.
The participants can use the Field Papers as a note and you (trainer) can
show them how to put imagery and use GPS data.
This could help them to edit their map in the same way.

FAQ (Frequently Asked Question)
*******************************

**Should I use a point or a polygon to identify a restaurant in a mall?**

You should use the point.
Polygons are used if you clearly know the shape of a building or area.
If you want to identify a landmark inside a larger polygon,
such as a building it is better to use a point.

**How to map a bridge in JOSM?**

To mark a bridge, you need to split the lines which marks the bridge (usually
a way) on both sides of the bridge.
If you have a road that crosses a river, you can click on the dots on the
side of the river and press 'P' on the keyboard to split the line at that
point.
Then the selected line can be tagged as bridge using the preset menu.

**How to digitize a building to have perfect rectangle shape?**

It is not easy to make a perfect rectangle only using you own hand.
Luckily there are tools that can make the proper angle at each corner of a
polygon.
Select the polygon (building) and press 'Q' on the keyboard to shape
that polygon.

**The map on OpenStreetMap does not show the edits immediately**

Usually it will take about 5-10 minutes to see your changes appearing
on the existing maps in OpenStreetMap.
If you can not see the changes on OpenStreetmap after that time it may be due
to your browser is still caching the old map.
The first step in this case is to reload the page in your browser.
If this is not successful you should delete the cache in your browser.
For example in Google Chrome you select Tools -> Clear Browsing Data.
Select "Empty the cache" and click "Clear browsing data.
Than refresh the page again and your edits should appear.
Sometimes it still can take a while until changes to OpenStreetMap appear on
the main page.

Common Problems
***************

You need to know that the Hot-Export server uses a first come - first serve
strategy.
That means the server serves the user who executes the first data request
first.
The size of the desired area also affects the process of Hot-Export.
The greater the total area is the longer the process will take.

**Error with osm2pgsql**

That means that the Hot-Export server has crashed.
This can occur because the storage space on the server HD is filled up and
there is no space left to process your data.
Report this disruption to team.id@hotosm.org.
