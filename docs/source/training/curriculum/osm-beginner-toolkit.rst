About Toolkit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**The Beginning OpenStreetMap Trainer Toolkit** is designed to prepare
trainers to deliver an introductory training course to new users of OSM. The
materials included will prepare trainers to conduct trainings with a variety
of audiences and to cover common problems and pitfalls,
and also provide trainers with the best methodologies to engage new mappers.

When organizing an OpenStreetMap workshop, numerous factors must be
considered, including the length of time you have to train,
available resources, number of trainee and their technical skills.  This
toolkit will help trainers prepare trainings for different types of
participants, but it will primarily focus on educating those with little or
no experience with GPS, map making, and computers.

The purpose of this toolkit is to prepare the trainer, to successfully train
workshop participants in adding spatial data to OpenStreetMap.

Purpose of Workshop
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This workshop is purposed to achieve competency standard and basic competency
as follows.

*Standard Competency*
*********************
Collecting Spatial Data with OSM

*Basic Competency*
******************
1. Drawing map of an area as basic understanding of *OpenStreetMap*
2. Be able to operate *OpenStreetMap*
3. Be able to operate *JOSM*
4. Be able to use *GPS* to add data to *OSM*
5. Be able to use *Field Papers* to add data to *OSM*
6. Be able to edit a map and add information to *OSM* using *JOSM*
7. Correct *imagery offset*
8. Getting *OSM* data in a specific format to be analyzed further in GIS
   (Geographic Information System) software

Workshop Materials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Basic concept of *OpenStreetMap* website
2. Working with *OSM*
3. Working with *JOSM*
4. Using *GPS*
5. *Field Papers*
6. Editing *OpenStreetMap* through *JOSM*
7. *Imagery Offset*
8. Getting *OSM* Data

Workshop Strategies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Methods applied in this workshop is participatory teaching,
   emphasizes on full participation of the participant in every section and
   activities during the workshop, instead of lecture method.
2. Participants oriented. Participants are encouraged to find and getting
   knowledge and skill needed by themselves.
3. Trainers serve as facilitators. Trainers only facilitate in order to the
   ideas emerged during the workshop come from the participants,
   not only from trainers. However, trainers must be ready and give the better
   knowledge and argument when the participants need any assistance.
4. *Outcome* oriented. Workshop must produces *outcomes* mentioned before.

3. Computer (ideally, one computer is used by two participants,
   but it will be better if one computer is used by one participant)
4. A Printer (to print out *Field Papers*)
5. A Projector (to present slide and demonstrate technical instruction and
   software)
6. *GPS* devices (ideally, one *GPS* is used by two or three participants in
   a group)
7. Battery for *GPS* devices
8. USB cable to connect *GPS* devices to computer
9. USB *Flashdisk* to transfer *file* and *software*
10. Good internet connection

FAQ (Frequently Asked Question)
*******************************

**How  did the UK begin mapping? How did OpenStreetMap start?**

*OpenStreetMap* start with just a handful of volunteers who had GPS devices.
They would go out, collect data on their GPS and make sketches of maps and
take notes, and then add the data into OSM database at home. These initial
volunteers hosted "Mapping Parties" in different towns,
in which anybody could come out with them one day and go mapping.  These
parties helped expand the network of volunteers, get more people involved,
and create great maps of different towns.

**How did they create maps so thoroughly? What technologies did they use?**

At the beginning, mappers only have GPS to work with, and any map  data that
was freely given to the *OpenStreetMap* community. Later,
*OSM* made a deal with *Yahoo!* To be able to use their satellite imagery
to draw maps with. More recently, Microsoft has made its imagery available
to *OSM*.

**Can we use OSM with Google Maps?**

It is not legal to use *Google Maps* as a resource when editing
*OpenStreetMap*.  Google has not given permission for this like Microsoft
has, and so it is not acceptable to use.

| - Basic concept of *OpenStreetMap* license. CC-by-SA is a         |               |               |
|   license which all of the data in *OpenStreetMap* can be used    |               | Module 2      |
|   by everyone freely, but the user must add  *OpenStreetMap*      |               |               |
|   attribution and contribute back to *OpenStreetMap*              |               |               |
| - If users choose public domain when they were *sign up*, it      |               |               |
|   means that they are do not care what OSM license is, and        |               |               |

FAQ (Frequently Asked Question)
*******************************

**Forget Password**

Sometimes participants forget their password. In this case,
you need to help
them to reset or make a new password, if that is not possible you have to
make a new email account. If the participants already have *OpenStreetMap*
account but they forget the password, you could help them to reset their
password and sent it to their email.

**Do not have email**

If participants do not have email account, you need to help them make a new one.

**The software not installed (Flash)**

If you decided to show participants how to edit using *Potlach editor* in the
*OSM* website, first they need to install Flash on their computer. The guide
to install flash is in the **Beginners Guide**.  Please remember this
activity would takes some hours for this session.

|        tag format. The good way to explain tag is describe it     |               |               |
|        as a label which put in the objects and every label        |               |               |
|        describe different attribute from that object              |               |               |

|        different attribute, but the easiest way to add it to the  |               |               |
|        objects is using presets menu.                             |               |               |
|      - Add your own preset to the menu.                           |               |               |

Common Problem
**************

**Setting on Mac and Ubuntu**

The Step to setting on Mac and Ubuntu is quite easy. JOSM is a software based
on Java so do with the platform independent, but you have to make sure your
Java is already installed in your computer system. GPSBabel does not have
GUI for Linux, so it would be hard to Linux users especially for newbie
users. This software does not include in system packet for Windows but it is
easy to download.

**JOSM runs out of memory**

Sometimes if someone download a lot of imagery and data on JOSM,
your computer runs out of memory and crash. The solution is start JOSM with
a batch file that will tell JOSM to add extra memory. A file batch example
is provide in this toolkit, but you have to edit it using text editor to put
the file-josm.jar in the right way.

**Participants add tag on nodes not in the ways**

Sometimes it is difficult to OSM new users to understand that way is consist
from some nodes. Therefore any tag that you put supposed add on the ways or
polygon rather than nodes on the ways. As an example, new users select all
nodes on the objects by draw a box around the object. This is make all of
nodes have tag whereas they supposed to do not have tag. This is important
for you to know from beginning, for a good mapping.

FAQ (Frequently Asked Question)
*******************************

**Is there any easy way to restart JOSM after we finish install plugins?**

Yes, there is a plugin that you can add which allow you to restart JOSM by
click a button. To activate it, install it in preferences.

**Could we make a tag in Bahasa Indonesia?**

Theoretical, you can add any tag to nodes, ways or shapes on OSM. But
because all of the objects on OSM save in international databases and cover
whole world, need consensus about how to make a tag. As an example,
hospital still a hospital in England, France, even Indonesia. If every
country give a tag with their own language it will be difficult and confusing
to show the icon or symbol for different location. Because OSM made in
England, English Language is language which accepted for tag. However if you
want to make preset menu using your own language it still possible and when
you click that preset is still can use.

**Could we change the color of nodes and ways and could we change the icon and symbol? How we print it?**

You can change the color of the objects in setting menu. This is very
useful, especially when we hard to see nodes on ways and shapes in different
background. When Participants ask about how to change the symbol or show the
name of objects, you need to tell them that this program is for editing data
not to see the preview or result and print a map. All of nodes and tag will
be saved in database, but some other software could you use to make your
map better. As an example is OpenStreetMap, but there is another more
available.  The difference between editing data and rendering on another
software might be quite hard to understand by participants in the beginning.

**What the difference between preset and tag?**

Tag is a part of information that you can put in nodes,
ways or shapes (polygon) to describe one of the attributes. Preset is a
simple way to give a tag to the objects without how to fix the tag manually.
As an example you have to give tag to the hospital with tag amenity=hospital
to identify it correctly, but because there is a lot of tag it is easier by
preset menu that will make a correct tag automatically.

Common Problem
**************

**Make sure you have battery and reserve cable**

It is not good thing if your GPS run of your battery,
so make sure every group have reserved battery when they go out to mapping.
When they come back, they need to move data from GPS to computer,
It is better if every group bring reserved cable so more fast when we want to
copy the data to computer.

**Same format to all GPS**

Before training, make sure all GPS in the same format,
this is for make participants not confuse. Main point that we have to make
sure are:

- Arrangement from page is same: Main Menu. Track Menu, Map, Satellites
- Save coordinate in decimal degrees
- Unit in meter
- Elevation has been calibrated

FAQ (Frequently Asked Question)
*******************************

**What projection that GPS use to collect the Data?**

GPS can be set to record in different projection, but for our need,
GPS we will be set on coordinate geographic WGS84.

**How accurate the GPS? How accuracy can affected the data?**

Your GPS usually has accuracy about 3-15 meter. Satellites pages on your GPS
indicate accuracy when in use. For mapping need, inaccuracy like that could
be ignored.

FAQ (Frequently Asked Question)
*******************************

**How we can print big size map? Example for poster or community mapping project?**

One of the best way to do this is using QGIS program, but this is would not
discuss in this session. You can make some clue about QGIS after you
practice and understand how to make a big size map. If you need to make it
now, you can using http://fieldpapers.org and make it together.

**How to scan Field Papers?**

You can use scanner or handphone or camera to take photo of field papers
then put it into JOSM.

**What should I do if upload process Field Papers really slow/do not work?**

Unfortunately, Field Papers website not always 100% working even the process
could be longer than your lunch break. This is the trainer could say to
participants. They can use Field Papers as a note and you (trainer) can show
to them how to put imagery and using GPS data, this is could help them to
edit their map with the same way.

**Should I use the point or polygon to identify a restaurant in a mall?**

You should use the point to which one. Polygon that good used if you know
clearly the shape of a building or area, and if you want to identify a
landmark in the larger polygon, such as a building is better to use point.

**How to mapping a bridge in JOSM?**

To mark a bridge, you need to do a split (separate) bridge lines along of
other parts of the line which is the usual way. If you have a road that
crosses a river, you can click on the dots on the side of the river and press
'P' on the keyboard to split the line at that point. Then the selected line
can be mark bridge with preset menu.

**How to create building was digitized have square perfect?**

Not easy to make a perfect box, then there are tools that can make the
proper angle at each corner of a polygon. Select polygon and press 'Q' on
the keyboard to shape polygon.

**The map has not been updated OpenStreetMap edits**

Usually it will take about 5-10 minutes to see change existing maps in
OpenStreetMap. If after that you still can not see the changes may be due to
your browser captures the old maps. The first step refresh your page. If not
successful then you should delete cache in your browser. You can choose for
example in Google Chrome you select Tools -> Clear Browsing Data. You can
select "Empty the cache" and click "Clear browsing data. After that you call
or go to the website again you have the new map should appear.

Common Problem
**************

You need to know that server Hot-Export using a first come-first serve means
the server serves the user who executes the first data request OSM. The size
of the desired area also affect the process of Hot-Export. The greater total
area will eat the longer process.

**Error with osm2pgsql**

It means hot-export server to crash. This can occur because the storage space
on the server hard drive was full. Report this disruption to
team.id@hotosm.org for later followed up.
