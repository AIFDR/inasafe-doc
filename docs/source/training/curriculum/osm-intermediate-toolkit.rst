About Toolkit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Intermediate level OpenStreetMapWorkshop Guide** is designed to prepare
facilitator to be able to organize intermediate training in terms of editing
OSM data. The material which is included will prepare you to organize
training for participant who already has experience with mapping and
editing map. The material was compiled for this training assume that all
the participants already attended **Beginner OpenStreetMap Training** and
already understand and familiar with basic editing techniques at JOSM.

When conducting a workshop of OpenStreetMap, many factors must be
considered, including how much time and resources owned,
number of participants, and the technical capabilities of the participants
themselves. This guide will help you to prepare workshop with different
types of participants. However, this all assumes that participants for
Intermediate workshop has had experience working with the OSM. Some
participants may be more adept than the others, and at this intermediate
level workshop, You will likely see a bigger gap on this training in terms
of ability and experience of the participants. Remember,
it is important to keep the participant who has been adept at OpenStreetMap
materials, but also not to leave participants who have not been too adept.
Placing participants in pairs sometimes can be a good idea,
that where one participant has been more proficient and her partner are
still not proficient.

Purpose for this guide is to preparing you, the facilitator,
to be able to teach participants successfully according to
**Intermediate OpenStreetMap Guide**.

Workshop Purpose
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The purpose of this training is to enhance the capabilities and skills of
the participants in performing editing OSM data on JOSM,
include intermediate editing techniques and emphasize on the quality of the
data. Intermediate level topics are also included in this workshop that is
working with **the private datastore** to create and make use of the
information on the Wiki OpenStreetMap.

The purpose of that already explained above can be elaborated into
competency standards and  basic competencies  as follows.

*Standard Competency*
*********************
Quality Assurance for contributing of OSM mapping

*Basic Competency*
******************
1. Applying better digitizing technique for improving quality of the
   resulting data.
2. Use JOSM Validation tools to ensure the quality of contribution of
   mapping given.
3. Resolving conflict when uploading OSM data
4. Creating preset file in JOSM
5. Using private data store feature for keep private data
6. Creating and editing page in OSM Wiki

Workshop Materials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Advanced Editing
2. Quality Assurance
3. Resolving Conflict when uploading OSM data
4. XML and presets in JOSM
5. Using Private Datastore
6. Wiki OpenStreetMap

Workshop Strategies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. The methods used are participatory methods, with emphasis on the full
   participation of the participants in the training process,
   rather than a method of speaking engagements.
2. Based on participants. Participants are encouraged to seek,
   find and acquire knowledge/skills that they needed independently.
3. Presenter act as facilitator. Presenter only facilitates ideas that come
   from any direction not only from presenter. In times of needed presenter
   should be able to provide reinforcement quality.
4. Oriented at outcome. Training of should produce outcome that has been
   mentioned.

Tools
^^^^^
1. Copy of Data Collection using OSM Intermediate Guide for participants
2. Indoor room with tables and chairs
3. Computer ( 1 computer used by maximum 2 peoples ideally)
4. Two projectors ( for present/deliver materials and demonstrate techniques
   in the use of application)
5. Flashdisk (for transfer files and software installers)
6. Stable internet connection
7. Snacks and drinks

Schedules
^^^^^^^^^
Below is the outline for a five-day training schedule that has been tested
to several different groups in several areas in Indonesia. You could just
provide a variety of changes that might be more useful depending on the
various factors that have been discussed before.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------+---------------+

FAQ (Frequently Asked Question)
*******************************

**I have set the building size, but why it only shows as a line not a polygon?**
It's because the zoom level problem. Try to zoom in into that line. It will
show the building after the proper zoom.

**I want create a circle, but why I got a very huge circle with 'create a circle' tool from utilsplugins2 tool?**
It's because when we want to create a circle we must add a way with 2 nodes.
If that way have more than 2 nodes, the result of the circle will be very big.

|    already has data that will be used as a conflict simple,       | Practice      |               |
|    namely data was in OpenStreetMap server and have OSM ID        |               |               |
|    from each points.                                              |               |               |

|    appear in conflict one of these. Before that, to make it       |               |               |
|    easier the facilitator could makes notes on OSM ID of the line |               |               |
|    that will become the nodes type conflict sample.               |               |               |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------+---------------+

Frequently Asked Question
*************************

**How to avoid conflict?**
You can try to divide your work area if in the one time there were two or
more user digitizing in the same area.

**What is the meaning of the green, yellow, and red colors from the node type conflicts?**
The green color means that the nodes are also in the OSM server and in the
same order. The yellow color means that the nodes are also in the OSM server
but not the same order. While the red color means that the nodes just in one
version, whether it is the version will be uploaded or the OSM server.

| Discuss about the private datastore session, usually participants |               |               |
| will ask how if you want to have own private datastore account    |               |               |
| if participants are serious with that can give proposal to HOT    |               |               |
| team and prepare a server if possible.                            |               |               |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------+---------------+

Common Problem :
****************

- Problem with internet connection if connection slow make the practice
  session become longer
- The online private datastore server can�t use together because limited
  bandwidth, so the participants are usually asked to not practice and just
  see the facilitator to practice.
