  This is basically a Copy & Paste Section from user-manual/options.rst but
  it should be kept here to have the socialisation short-manual available as
  compact as possible. The Option Section should be kept up to date in the
  User manual and should be copy/pasted after updating it there.

Helpful Hints And Tips
======================
**Objectives:**

* To read through the |project_name| option menu
* To know where to go for help
* To go through some frequently asked questions

**Expected Results:**

Participants are able to:

* customise the |project_name| option menu
* know where to go for help


You have now gone through |project_name| using 4 different natural hazards,
changing a variety of parameters and analysing the results. This chapter has
been designed to help you understand a little more about |project_name| as
well as where you can go for help.

|project_name| option menu
--------------------------
.. COPY PASTE from USER MANUAL SECTION OPTIONS FROM HERE

The |project_name| plugin provides an options dialog which allows you to
define various options relating to how |project_name| will behave. The
options dialog can be launched by clicking on the |project_name| plugin
toolbar's options icon (as shown below) or by doing
:menuselection:`Plugins --> InaSAFE --> InaSAFE Options`.

.. figure:: /static/inasafe-options-icon.png
   :align:   center

Then the dialog will appear, looking something like this:

.. figure:: /static/inasafe-options-dialog.png
   :align:   center

.. note:: You can click on the :guilabel:`Help` button at any time and it
   will open the help documentation browser to this page.

The following options are available on the :guilabel:`Options Dialog`:

* :guilabel:`Only show visible layers in the InaSAFE dock` : This option will
  determine whether **all** (when unchecked) hazard and impact layers should
  be listed in the |project_name| dock's combo boxes. or (when checked) only
  visible layers.
* :guilabel:`Set QGIS layer name from 'title' in keywords` : This option will
  (when enabled) cause QGIS to name layers in the :guilabel:`Layers tree`
  using the `title` keyword in the layer's keywords file. If the layer
  has no 'title' in its keywords, or it has no keywords at all, the normal
  QGIS behaviour for naming layers will apply.
* :guilabel:`Zoom to impact layer on scenario estimate completion` : This
  option will cause the map view to zoom in/out in order to completely contain
  the |project_name| impact scenario map output when an analysis completes.
* :guilabel:`Hide exposure layer on scenario estimate completion` : This
  option will cause QGIS to turn off the exposure layer used when
  |project_name| completes the current analysis. You can re-enable the layer
  visibility again by checking its checkbox in the legend.
* :guilabel:`Clip datasets to visible extent before analysis` : This
  option will cause QGIS to clip hazard and exposure layers to the currently
  visible extent on the map canvas.
* :guilabel:`When clipping, also clip features (e.g. will clip polygon
  smaller)`: This option will any polygons that extend beyond the analysis
  extents to be clipped so that they are contained by the analysis extents.
  For example if you have a flood hazard polygon layer that extends far
  beyond your area of interest, the flood polygons will be reduced so that
  only the part inside of your area of interested is retained. This can
  speed up processing time somewhat.
* :guilabel:`Help to improve InaSAFE by submitting errors to a remote server` :
  This option, when enabled, will submit diagnostic information back to an
  |project_name| project server in the event of any error taking place that
  we are able to trap. The information provided is useful to the
  |project_name| team to improve the robustness of the software we produce
  and to spot trends in issues people encounter. Please note the warning text
  below this option which is included here in full:

.. note:: The above setting requires a QGIS restart to disable / enable.
   Error messages and diagnostic information will be posted to
   http://sentry.linfiniti.com/inasafe-desktop/. Some institutions may not
   allow you to enable this feature - check with your network administrator
   if unsure. Although the data is submitted anonymously,
   the information contained in tracebacks may contain file system paths
   which reveal your identity or other information from your system.

* :guilabel:`Show intermediate layers generated by postprocessing` : This
  option will cause QGIS to show the intermediate files generated by the
  postprocessing steps in the map canvas.
* :guilabel:`Default female ratio` : This is the default female to total
  population ratio used por generating Gender breakdowns
* :guilabel:`Keyword cache for remote datasources` : This option is used to
  determine where keywords are stored for datasets where it is not possible
  to write them into a .keywords file. See :ref:`keywords-system` in the
  |project_name| User-Manual for more information on the keywords system.
* :guilabel:`Run analysis in separate thread (experimental)` : This option
  cause the analysis to be run in its own thread.

.. warning:: It is not recommended to use the threaded implementation at this
   time. For this reason it is disabled by default.

.. note:: Pressing
   :guilabel:`Cancel` at any time will close the options
   dialog and any changes made will **not** be applied.
   Pressing :guilabel:`Ok` at any time will close the options dialog and any
   changes made **will** be applied immediately.

.. note:: The exact button order shown on this dialog may differ depending on
   your operating system or desktop environment.

We encourage you to check (in addition to the default ones):

* When clipping, also clip features (e.g. will clip polygon smaller)
* Help to improve |project_name| by submitting errors to a remote server

|project_name| Website
----------------------

This manual is by no far the only documentation on |project_name|.  Within
the |project_name| website you can find not only documentation on training,
but all user documentation and developer documentation.  This website is also
updated with every new release.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

**Do I need to pay to use InaSAFE?**
No, the software is completely Free and Open Source.

**What license is InaSAFE published under?**
|project_name| is published under the GPL version 2 license,
the full text of which is available at www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt.
Under the terms of the license of you may freely copy,
share and modify the software, as long as you make it available under the
same license.

**How is the project funded?**
The project is being developed for the good of humanity and has been jointly
developed by |BNPB|, AusAid & the World Bank.

**I found a bug, how should I report it?**
We manage the project issues using a GitHub issue tracker. The |project_name|
issue tracker is open to everyone, though you will first need to register a
(free) account on GitHub to use it. You can find the GitHub self-registration
page https://github.com/signup/free.
Otherwise email inasafe-users@googlegroups.com

**Could we request a new feature?**
If you have a feature request, please use the issue tracker to let us know
about it, using the same procedure as for bug reporting.
Otherwise email inasafe-users@googlegroups.com

**Where do I get Hazard and Exposure data from?**
As explained in |project_name| functionality chapter (page 13),
you are able to get open exposure data from  www.asiapop.org for population
and  from OpenStreetMap for structures (however you may need to still
digitise the structures go to www.learnosm.org for more details). To download
OSM data see Appendix :guilabel:`Getting OpenStreetMap Data` (page 56).
For hazard information it is best to approach your government science
agencies or local universities to model earthquake,
tsunami or floods. However if it floods regularly in your region you could
also develop a community flood-prone footprint.

**Why does the plugin not show up in my QGIS Plugin Manager?**
One common issue is that if you upgraded from QGIS 1.7.x to 1.8 you may not
get the new plugin repo added to your repo list. To fix this you can do:

#. open :guilabel:`QGIS`
#. Go :guilabel:`Plugins` -> Fetch Python Plugins
#. click :guilabel:`Repositories` tab
#. click :guilabel:`add`
#. Name: Official QGIS Repository
#. Url: http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml
#. :guilabel:`Save` it and the plugin repo list should update. If it does not,
   close and open QGIS to force an update.
#. In the :guilabel:`python plugin manager` main tab now you should find
   |project_name| available
