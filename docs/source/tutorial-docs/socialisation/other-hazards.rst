Other Hazards in InaSAFE
========================

Objectives:
-----------

* To run InaSAFE with other hazards, specifically Volcano and Earthquake
* To save a subset of an existing layer
* To acknowledge the memory limitation of your computer
* To understand the difference in scale between hazards
* To run InaSAFE using a Tsunami model (optional)

Expected Results:
-----------------

Participants are able to:

* save a selected feature
* run a Volcano scenario in InaSAFE using a volcano vent location
* determine the best course of action to fix a memory error
* run an Earthquake scenario in InaSAFE using a shakemap
* run a Tsunami scenario in InaSAFE (optional)

Volcanoes in Indonesia
----------------------

There are 129 active volcanoes in Indonesia, and its always valuable to know how many people, or how much infrastructure is in a certain perimeter of the vent.Hence InaSAFE is able to use a vent location (point) as a hazard layer, the dataset that we are going to use came from downloading locations from Smithsonian website.  You may ask “How can we use a point to figure out impact? InaSAFE needs your help!.

1. Open a QGIS project called Volcano_Indonesia.qgs - File/Open Project... , navigate to InaSAFE projects and select Volcano_Indonesia
