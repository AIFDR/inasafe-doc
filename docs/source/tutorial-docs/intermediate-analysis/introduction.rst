Introduction============Welcome to the Intermediate Unit on Spatial Analysis.  By now you should be adept in data collection techniques and have a solid foundation in analysis with QGIS.  In this unit we will be focusing again on InaSAFE and QGIS skills that aid in contingency planning.First, we will undertake a review of unit 2, to ensure that we remember all the QGIS skills that we studied.  Then we will begin working on another InaSAFE project using flood data as our hazard.  We will consider the best possible evacuation routes and locations for IDP camps, calculate damages and losses and learn how to display them on a map.This unit covers much of what we have been working toward.  We will bring together the data which we now know how to collect in OpenStreetMap, QGIS spatial analysis skills, and the power of InaSAFE to help develop effective and informative contingency plans.
