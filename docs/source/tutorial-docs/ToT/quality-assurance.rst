Quality Assurance==================Basic Competitions-------------------After studying this chapter, participants will be able to:-	Understand how to provide tags or spatial attributes appropriately and accurately -	Understanding error messages and warnings from validation tool in JOSM A. Presets Standardization ---------------------------OpenStreetMap allow the entire user to giving information as much as possible on their map. This can be noted on each mapped object using the available preset list menu on the editor of JOSM.  Sometimes we find an inconsistency in the provision of information on various objects. Thus is created the standardization of the presets list. This standardization presets was created with a purposes:1. Data consistency 2. Facilitate search and data processing3. As benchmarks in the provision of information via presets4. As a reference to when validation make improvements or data5. Maximize the use of existing in internal presets josm6. Maximize data visuals OpenStreetMap at the websiteWith the standardization of this preset, all users are expected to use this standard OSM when doing the editing. One of the advantages of using internal presets that are already available in JOSM is later visualization object will appear on the website of OpenStreetMap.List of standard preset with some naming convention can be found in the Appendix. The attachment contains all the most commonly used presets along with the explanation of how to tag images as well as examples of its object. B. Validation-------------Validation is one of many ways to improve OpenStreetMap data quality with check and solve errors and warnings in JOSM. Previously we have discussed ensures the quality in Intermediate (secondary) guidelines regarding the initial stage performs validation. In this chapter the material validation will be explained further and details about the types of warnings (warning) that always appear when doing validation and solutions that are used to correct these problems. Below is some kind of warning (warning) that often appear when a validation in JOSM, among other.### 1. Similarly Named Way .. image:: /static/tutorial/ToT/1_tot.png   :align: centerThe picture above is one example of a warning in JOSM. Problems in the picture are two or more paths have the same name as the first street (Samudera 2 Street) while the second street (Samudera 3 street). For this problem we need a solution that you may ignore this warning if the path name is correct or you do not know the actual name of the street. If the street name is not in accordance with the field you should change the name of the street. ### 2. Way end node near other highways   .. image:: /static/tutorial/ToT/1_tot_2.png   :align: center   This warnings appears if the end road to connect to other road.. image:: /static/tutorial/ToT/1_tot_3.png   :align: centerThe image above shows the existing roads are not connected with other roads and even through the other way. If we encounter problems like this can be solved by using the "Join Node to Way" or the shortcut key "J". You do this by selecting the node / point on the road first then the point is shifted to near the other way and then select the "Join Node to Way".### 3. Unnamed Ways .. image:: /static/tutorial/ToT/1_tot_4.png   :align: centerThe picture above shows the problems caused by the existing roads are not connected with other roads and even through the other way. For this problem, we can do the settlement by using the "Join Node to Way" or the shortcut key "J". You do this by selecting the node / point on the road first then the point is shifted to near the other way and then select the "Join Node to Way".### 4. Nodes at same position.. image:: /static/tutorial/ToT/1_tot_5.png   :align: center The picture above has the problem of the dots are overlapping each other inside an object at the same position. To fix this problem we need to remove the points that are overlapping.### 5. Ways with same position .. image:: /static/tutorial/ToT/1_tot_6.png   :align: centerThe image above shows the problems of a polygon outline overlapping each other on the same object. If we find problems like this can be solved in two ways, namely:1. Remove the overlapping polygon outline2. On this image objects having warning located outside the territorial area of the downloaded then we should ignore or do not fix it to avoid conflicts when uploading### 6. Area style way is not close.. image:: /static/tutorial/ToT/1_tot_7.png   :align: centerThe image above shows the problem of building a polygon or not covered. If you find problems like this can be solved in two ways, namely:1. Connect the initial node and the last node with Merge Nodes2. Click the last node and connect the start node using the Draw Nodes### 7. No tags-Unconnected nodes with physical tags .. image:: /static/tutorial/ToT/1_tot_8.png   :align: centerShown in the picture above there is a point that is not connected to an existing line or polygon and point it also does not have tag / any information. If the point does not have a role or any information, the only way to resolve this problem is to remove the point / node.
