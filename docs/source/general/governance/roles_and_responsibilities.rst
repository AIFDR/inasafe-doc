Roles and Responsibilities
==========================
|project_name| was conceived and initially developed by the Indonesia's
National Disaster Management Agency (|BNPB|) and the Department of Foreign
Affairs and Trade - Australian Aid, through the Australia-Indonesia Facility
for Disaster Reduction (|AIFDR|) and the World Bank - Global Facility for
Disaster Reduction and Recovery (World Bank-|GFDRR|).

|AIFDR| in coordination with |BNPB| are driving the development of
|project_name| through the use of |project_name| in 6 Indonesian provinces.
After the launch of |project_name| in October 2012, |AIFDR| on behalf of
|BNPB| and |GoA| conducted scenario development for contingency
planning training in 6 Indonesian provinces through the Humanitarian
OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) and the University of Gadjah Mada (UGM). The
training consisted of 2 sections, data collection through OpenStreetMap and
data analysis through QGIS and InaSAFE.
The training was conducted in 3 stage beginner, intermediate and Train the
Trainer.
At present the training program is being revised by HOT to incorporate
lessons learnt in the field as well as upgrades to the software.

The use of the |project_name| has trigged an avalanche of new feature
request that has been prioritised by |BNPB| and |AIFDR| and is being
developed by |Linfiniti|.
See :ref:`road_map` for more details.  UGM is also conducting an 8 month
scoping mission interviewing disaster managers, scientist,
and other stakeholders to devise a priority list for |project_name| in
Indonesia.

The World Bank through |GFDRR| is developing an online version of
|project_name|, using the core functionality of QGIS-InaSAFE,
the online version will allow people to complete the same core analysis
without having to download the software.
|GFDRR| is also helping other countries to roll out InaSAFE to disaster
managers in the field.

Technical Working Group
-----------------------

|project_name| Technical Working Group (TWG) are the day to day drivers of
InaSAFE. At present we have only 4 core members of the TWG,
they are the nominated person from each of the 3 agencies |BNPB|,
|AIFDR| and |GFDRR| as well as the release manager.

This group is responsible for ensuring the integrity of the software,
specifically:

* programming is of a high standard and include unit testing
* documentation and website
* translating
* maintaing |project_name| roadmap

Expectations of TWG members
............................

It is expected that the TWG members are able to coordinate the development of
|project_name| by managing their agencies and contractors to deliver the
features outlined in |project_name|'s roadmap.  Additionally TWG should draw
on experiences from |project_name| trainers and users to continually update
|project_name|'s roadmap.

Project Steering Committee
--------------------------

The high level decisions and strategic direction for the InaSAFE project is
governed by the Project Steering Committee (PSC).

This group is responsible for approving the |project_name| roadmap.
