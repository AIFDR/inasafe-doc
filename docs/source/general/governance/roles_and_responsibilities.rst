Roles and Responsibilities
==========================
|project_name| was conceived and initially developed by Indonesia's National
Disaster Management Agency (|BNPB|) and the Department of Foreign Affairs and
Trade - Australian Aid, through the Australia-Indonesia Facility for Disaster
Reduction (|AIFDR|) and the World Bank - Global Facility for Disaster Reduction
and Recovery (World Bank-|GFDRR|).

|AIFDR| in coordination with |BNPB| are driving the development of
|project_name| through the use of |project_name| in 6 Indonesian provinces.
After the launch of |project_name| in October 2012, |AIFDR| on behalf of |BNPB|
and |GoA| conducted scenario development for contingency planning training in 6
Indonesian provinces through the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) and the
University of Gadjah Mada (UGM). The training consisted of 2 sections, data
collection through OpenStreetMap and data analysis through QGIS and
|project_name|. The training was conducted in 3 stages: beginner, intermediate
and Train the Trainer. At present the training program is being revised to
incorporate lessons learnt in the field, upgrades to the software and to better
align with |BNPB| national curriculum.

The use of the |project_name| has triggered a lot of new feature requests that
have been prioritised by |BNPB| and|AIFDR| and are being developed by |Kartoza|.
See :ref:`road_map` for more details. In 2014, UGM conducted a scoping mission
interviewing disaster managers, scientist, and other stakeholders to devise a
priority list for |project_name| in Indonesia.

In September 2014, a technical workshop was held in Jakarta bringing together
disaster managers, software developers, trainers and users. This workshop
provided a valuable opportunity for |project_name| enthusiasts to identify new
opportunities to work together in the future.

The World Bank through |GFDRR| is developing an online version of
|project_name|, using the core functionality of QGIS-|project_name|, the
online version will allow people to complete the same core analysis without
having to download the software. |GFDRR| is also helping other countries to
deliver |project_name| to disaster managers in the field.

Technical Working Group
-----------------------

|project_name| Technical Working Group (TWG) are the day to day drivers of
|project_name|. At present we have only 4 core members of the TWG, they are the
nominated person from each of the 3 agencies |BNPB|, |AIFDR| and |GFDRR| as
well as the release manager.

This group is responsible for ensuring the integrity of the software,
specifically:

* software development is of a high standard and includes unit testing
* documentation and website
* translating
* maintaining |project_name| roadmap

Expectations of TWG members
............................

It is expected that the TWG members are able to coordinate the development of
|project_name| by managing their agencies and contractors to deliver the
features outlined in |project_name|'s roadmap. Additionally the TWG should draw
on experiences from |project_name| trainers and users to continually update
|project_name|'s roadmap.

Project Steering Committee
--------------------------

The high level decisions and strategic direction for the |project_name|
project is governed by the Project Steering Committee (PSC).

This group is responsible for approving the |project_name| roadmap.
