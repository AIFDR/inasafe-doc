Project Governance
==================

|project_name| has been developed as an Open Source project to ensure world wide 
collaboration, as well as transparency and quality of the software. |project_name|
relies on disaster managers, developers, trainers, translators and of course users to 
develop the software. 

People from all over the world are currently working on this project, so we thought
it would be best to list here who they are, who they work for and their skill base 
:ref:`community`.

|project_name| still has a public release procedure which represents an endorsed 
version of the software.  The new release is stored in the Quantum GIS repository.
The procedure is documented here :ref:`governance`
