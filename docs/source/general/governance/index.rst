Project Governance
==================

|project_name| has been developed as an Open Source project to ensure world wide
collaboration, as well as transparency and quality of the software. |project_name|
relies on disaster managers, developers, trainers, translators and of course users to 
develop and improve the software. 

People from all over the world are currently working on this project, so we thought
it would be best to list the :ref:`community`; who they are, who they work for and their 
skill base. Additionally we have allocated certain people to coordinate the 
development of |project_name| and their :ref:`roles-and-responsibilities` are key part
in ensure the continue development of |project_name|. 

|project_name| still has a public release procedure which represents an endorsed
version of the software.  The procedure and requirements are list in :ref:`release`.
The new release is stored in the Quantum GIS repository.
