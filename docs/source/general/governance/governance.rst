Release Procedure
=================
The software development adheres to the following stringent quality measures:
Testing: At least 2/3rds of all lines of code must be successfully exercised by a regression test suite which is distributed alongside the software itself.
Clarity: The software complies with the appropriate development standards for the language used, i.e. the coding style guide (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) and has been peer reviewed.
Disclaimer: The software includes a clear Disclaimer of Warranty and appropriate Limitation of Liability clause. In this case this is achieved by using the GNU General Public Use v3 License (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).
History: The software is maintained in a source control system which allows full visibility of its history, tracking of issue resolution and potential reversal of past changes.
Authenticity: Source control system codes uniquely identify each individual version of the software making it possible to verify its origin.
As the public releases represent endorsed versions of the software, they are the focal points where AusAID potentially get exposed to the above mentioned risks. A formal release process is a risk control mechanism designed to verify that the software meets the appropriate standards. We propose the following framework to define responsibilities and accountability
The attached form is used to approve each release. However, the authority to sign-off depends on the scale of the release as outlined in the attached definition of release levels.
Major releases pose the largest changes and therefore the biggest potential exposure to risk. Consequently, it requires approval from a majority of the PSC testified by signing the attached release form.
Minor releases pose medium changes to the software and require approval from a majority of the TWG using the same form.
Point releases pose only minor changes so require only approval from any of the TWG members.
