The Philippines adopts Indonesia’s open source disaster mitigation tool
=======================================================================

`The Department of Science and Technology <http://www.dost.gov.ph/>`_  revealed
plans to adopt `InaSAFE <http://inasafe.org/>`_, a disaster mitigation
technology from Indonesia, to its `Nationwide Operational Assessment of
Hazard <http://noah.dost.gov.ph/>`_ (NOAH) project in a bid to improve
disaster planning and preparedness in the country.

`InaSAFE <http://inasafe.org/>`_, or Indonesia Scenario Assessment for
Emergency, is an open source software that produces realistic natural hazard
impact scenarios to help decision makers in their disaster planning,
preparedness and response activities.

It combines data from various authoritative sources to provide insights into
the likely impacts of future disaster events. The software is focused on
examining, in detail; the impacts by a single hazard would have on specific
sectors. It gives users a heightened situational awareness of the areas
affected and those that are likely to be affected, how many
people will need to be evacuated and what roads will be closed among others.

According to an official statement, NOAH will adopt Indonesia’s
`InaSAFE <http://inasafe.org/>`_ because it has a lot in common with the
Philippines, especially in topography and natural hazards.

Abigail Baca, disaster and risk management officer of the World Bank East
Asia and Pacific Region said that InaSAFE proved effective during the recent
floods in Jakarta, Indonesia and it can be applied in the Philippines.

Meanwhile, Dr. Alfredo Francisco Mahar Lagmay of Project NOAH disclosed that
`InaSAFE <http://inasafe.org/>`_ will be integrated into Project NOAH to
supplement existing technologies used to mitigate, if not totally prevent,
massive destruction caused by strong typhoons similar to tropical storm Washi
in 2011 and Bopha in December 2012.

“It is important to develop information tools that will help centralise risk
information at the NOAH website and make them available to a wider
community,” he said.

`InaSAFE <http://inasafe.org/>`_ is available free of charge. Interested
parties can get the code from
`GitHub <https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe#readme>`_.

DOST’s Project NOAH adopts Indonesian technology for disaster mitigation
========================================================================

The Department of Science and Technology’s (DOST) Project NOAH (Nationwide
Operational Assessment of Hazards) is adopting the disaster mitigating
technology called `InaSAFE <http://inasafe.org/>`_ from Indonesia.
`InaSAFE <http://inasafe.org/>`_ is an acronym for Indonesia Scenario
Assessment for Emergency.

It is an open source technology, which means it is free,
readily accessed from the internet and may be modified by users. With this
technology, data coming from weather scientists, local government units and
communities are gathered and consolidated to provide accurate information on
future disaster events. NOAH adopted Indonesias’s InaSAFE as it has a lot in
common with the Philippines, especially in topography and natural hazards.
This was disclosed during the multi-stakeholder assembly titled “Enhancing
Community Resilience Through the Use of New Technology” conducted by Project
NOAH.

Abigail Baca, disaster and risk management officer of the World Bank East
Asia and Pacific Region said that `InaSAFE <http://inasafe.org/>`_ proved
effective during the recent floods in Jakarta and Indonesia; thus,
they arrived at a conclusion that it can be likewise applied in the
Philippines.

Dr. Alfredo Francisco Mahar Lagmay of Project NOAH disclosed that InaSAFE
will be integrated into Project NOAH to supplement existing technologies used
to mitigate, if not totally prevent, massive destruction caused by strong
typhoons similar to Sendong in 2011and Pablo in December 2012.

During his presentation, Dr. Lagmay said, “It is important to develop
information tools that will help centralize risk information at the NOAH
website and make them available to a wider community.” Since its launch in
July 2012 in Marikina City, Project NOAH has continuously upgraded and
strengthened its capability through the installation of various weather
forecasting equipment in various disaster-prone areas in the country. Among
these are the Hydromet water level sensors and Doppler radars used to measure
the amount of rainfall in a specific area.

To date, there are 525 Hydromet sensors installed in different river systems,
including those in Tullahan River, Marikina River and San Juan River in
Metro Manila. Likewise, the Project NOAH team has put up billboards in
Pampanga showing flood maps to inform residents of the high-risk areas in
their communities.

Further, Dr. Enrico C. Paringit, project leader of NOAH’s DREAM LiDAR
(Disaster Risk and Exposure Assessment for Mitigation-Light Detection and
Ranging) said, “ Since November 2012, we were able to do three-dimensional or
3D mapping of the Pampanga river basin, Agno River,
Cagayan de Oro and Iligan. By the end of May this year,
3D mapping for Iloilo will be complete and next in line is the Panay river basin.”
