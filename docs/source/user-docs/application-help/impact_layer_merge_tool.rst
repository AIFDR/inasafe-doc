The Impact Layer Merge Tool
===========================

In some cases you may wish to create a report containing the combined output of
two impact functions for the same area. For example You may carry out an
assessment of the impact of a flood on population and on buildings and combine
the results into a single report. The impact layer merge tool allows you to do
this.

Prerequisites
-------------

In order to use this tool, please bear in mind the following requirements:

* Both impact layers should be loaded in your current project.
* Both impact layers should have been created for the same geographic region.
* The same aggregation area should be used for both assessments.

Procedure
---------

To use this tool, follow this procedure:

* Run an impact assessment for an area using aggregation. e.g.Flood Impact on
  Buildings aggregated by municipal boundaries.
* Run a second impact assessment for the same area using the same aggregation.
  e.g. Flood Impact on People aggregated by municipal boundaries.
* Open impact merge tool and select each impact layer from the pick lists
  provided.
* Select the aggregation layer that was used to generate the first and second
  impact layer.
* Select an output directory.
* Click OK to generate the per aggregation area combined summaries.

Generated outputs
-----------------

The tool will generate a PDF per aggregation area. The PDFs will be placed in
the designated output directory after completion of the merge process. The
output will consist of a map page and a table page. These are illustrated
below:

   Map page generated by the impact merge tool.


.. figure:: /static/user-docs/impact_merge_table.*
   :scale: 75 %

   Table page generated by the impact merge tool.

In the case of impact assessments where **no** aggregation has been used, only
a single pdf report is generated. In the case of impact assessments where
aggregation **has** been used, one pdf is generated per aggregation area.

.. note:: After report generation completes, you need to manually open the
    output directly with your file manager in order to view the resulting PDFs.
