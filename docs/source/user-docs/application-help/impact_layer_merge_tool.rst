The Impact Layer Merge Tool
===========================

In some cases you may wish to create a report containing the combined output of
two impact functions for the same area for the **same hazard, different
exposures**. For example You may carry out an assessment of the impact of a
flood on population and on buildings and combine the results into a single
report. The impact layer merge tool allows you to do this.

Prerequisites
-------------

In order to use this tool, please bear in mind the following requirements:

* Both impact layers should be loaded in your current project.
* Both impact layers should have been created for the same geographic region.
* The same aggregation area should be used for both assessments.

Procedure
---------

To use this tool, follow this procedure:

* Run an impact assessment for an area using aggregation. e.g.Flood Impact on
  Buildings aggregated by municipal boundaries.
* Run a second impact assessment for the same area using the same aggregation.
  e.g. Flood Impact on People aggregated by municipal boundaries.
* Open impact merge tool and select each impact layer from the pick lists
  provided.
* Select the aggregation layer that was used to generate the first and second
  impact layer.
* Select an output directory.
* Check 'Use customized report template' checkbox and select the report template 
  file if you want to use your own template. Note that all the map composer 
  components that are needed must be fulfilled.
* Click OK to generate the per aggregation area combined summaries.

Generated outputs
-----------------

The tool will generate a PDF per aggregation area. The PDFs will be placed in
the designated output directory after completion of the merge process. The
output will consist of a map page and a table page. These are illustrated
below:

   Map page generated by the impact merge tool.


.. figure:: /static/user-docs/impact_merge_table.*
   :scale: 75 %
   :align: center
   :alt: Impact merge report - table page

   Table page generated by the impact merge tool.

In the case of impact assessments where **no** aggregation has been used, only
a single pdf report is generated. In the case of impact assessments where
aggregation **has** been used, one pdf is generated per aggregation area.

.. note:: After report generation completes, the output directory will be 
   opened automatically.

Using Customized Template
-------------------------
The default template report is located in
:file:`/resources/qgis-composer-templates/merged-report.qpt`.
If that template does not satisfy your needs, you can use your own report template.
Before using your own report template, make sure that your template contains
all of these elements with id:

* **impact-map**, a QgsComposerMap
* **safe-logo**, a QgsComposerPicture
* **summary-report**, a QgsComposerLabel
* **aggregation-area**, a QgsComposerLabel
* **map-scale**, a QgsComposerScaleBar
* **map-legend**, a QgsComposerLegend
* **organisation-logo**, a QgsComposerPicture
* **merged-report-table**, a QgsComposerHTML

If any of those elements does not exist on the report template, the tools will 
give you the information of what element is missing on the template. 

.. note:: You can arrange those elements in any position you want.

Map Template Elements
---------------------
In terms of value replacement, there are three groups of elements on the template:

1. Elements that can be changed on InaSAFE Options tool. To change the value of these elements, 
please go to **InaSAFE Option** tools and change the value of the related field. 
Those elements are:

* **organisation-logo**. It corresponds to **Organisation logo** field on
  InaSAFE Option tools.
  If you do not fill this field, then the default one,
  **supporters.png** logo, will be used.
* **disclaimer**. It corresponds to **Disclaimer text** field on InaSAFE
  Option tools.
  If you do not fill this field, then the default one will be used: "InaSAFE
  has been jointly developed by Indonesian Government-BPNB, Australian Govenment-AIFDR and the World
  Bank-GFDRR. These agencies and the individual software developers of InaSAFE take no responsibility for 
  the correctness of outputs from InaSAFE or decisions derived as a consequence."

2. Elements containing tokens. The id of these element is not significant, only the token 
it contains. At render time, any of these tokens will be replaced. If you want to have a 
label containing value of these elements, enclose these elements with [] on a label i.e 
**[impact-title]** or **[hazard-title]**. Those elements are listed below:

* **impact-title**. It indicates the title of two impacts. The value will be "*first_impact_title* and *second_impact_title*"
* **hazard-title**. It indicates the hazard title used to generate the impact layer. 

3. Elements that are direcly updated by the renderer. All of these elements below are 
generated automatically by the tools.

* **impact-map**. It contains the map of two impact layers.
* **summary-report**. It contains the summary of the impact from two impact layers.
* **aggregation-area**. It contains the name of the aggregation area.
* **map-scale**. It indicates the scale of the map. To work with any layer projection preferences, we encourage you to use a numeric scale bar.
* **map-legend**. It shows the legend of merged impact layers. The map legend on default template is set to have 2 columns showing each impact layer legend.
* **merged-report-table**. It contains the detailed informations of each impact.
